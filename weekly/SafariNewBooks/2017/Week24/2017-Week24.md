Having learned their craft as a thought-intensive, independent activity, many web developers typically begin their careers by working as a team of one. Yet, in today’s dynamic workforce, web development is a highly social endeavor where developers collaborate with one another to build complex systems. This report provides guidelines for working effectively with other developers, particularly when it comes to making compromises, writing documentation, and interacting with open source in ways you can’t achieve as a solo learner.Author Adam Scott explores widely accepted methods for writing quality code, contributing work to open source, improving your documentation practices, and—perhaps most critical—respecting and involving every member of your team. As part of the series on ethical web development, this report emphasizes how empathetic development practices like these will help you create empathetic products.You’ll learn guidelines to help you:Produce quality code by leveraging coding standards, version control, testing, and automated checks in a team environmentRelease your project code as open source, complete with clear documentation and codes of conductWrite useful code documentation that’s comprehensive, welcoming, and collaborativeCreate an inclusive and safe environment for fellow developers, both at work and at group eventsThis is the fourth report in the Ethical Web Development series from author Adam Scott. Previous reports in this series include Building Web Apps for Everyone, Building Web Apps That Work Everywhere, and Building Web Apps that Respect a User's Privacy and Security.

Stretching across 500 miles of northern Spain, the Camino de Santiago has been a pilgrimage route for a millennium. Each year, hundreds of thousands of peregrinos make their way through rugged countryside and medieval towns in order to reflect, test their will, and join a community of strangers on a shared mission. In short, it's the ideal training ground for authentic leadership.Challenged to walk the Camino, Victor Prince began his trek as one person: driven, work-focused and highly competitive, and he finished it a very different one: more balanced, more caring, and more present in the moment. In this transformative book he guides readers on their own Camino, translating his experience into seven essential leadership lessons inspired by the values emblazoned on the back of every pilgrim's passport:Treat each day as its own adventureMake others feel welcomeLearn from those who've walked beforeConsider your impact on those who followAnd moreLeadership is a journey. The Camino Way prepares you to tackle it with a pilgrim's heart, a wayfarer's grit, and a leader's vision.

Layout designers rejoice: CSS finally has an update that will make your lives easier. Flexible box layout, often called Flexbox, frees you from the challenges of creating layouts with floats and padding and lets you specify containers and their contents instead. The new model means you can specify the directions in which material flows, how content wraps, and the ways components can expand to fill a space. Whether you've been creating large sites or small, fixed sites or responsive sites, flexbox will simplify your work.

AbstractThis IBM® Redbooks® publication is a detailed technical guide to
the IBM System Storage® SAN Volume Controller, which is powered by
IBM Spectrum Virtualize™ Version 7.8.IBM SAN Volume Controller is a virtualization appliance
solution, which maps virtualized volumes that are visible to hosts
and applications to physical volumes on storage devices. Each
server within the storage area network (SAN) has its own set of
virtual storage addresses that are mapped to physical addresses. If
the physical addresses change, the server continues running by
using the same virtual addresses that it had before. Therefore,
volumes or storage can be added or moved while the server is still
running.The IBM virtualization technology improves the management of
information at the "block" level in a network, which enables
applications and servers to share storage devices on a network.

AbstractFor more than 50 years, IBM® mainframes have supported an
extraordinary portion of the world's computing work, providing
centralized corporate databases, and mission-critical
enterprise-wide applications. IBM z® Systems, the latest generation
of the IBM distinguished family of mainframe systems, has come a
long way from its IBM System/360 heritage. Likewise, its IBM z/OS®
operating system is far superior to its predecessors in providing,
among many other capabilities, world-class and state-of-the-art
support for the TCP/IP Internet protocol suite.TCP/IP is a large and evolving collection of communication
protocols managed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), an
open, volunteer organization. Because of its openness, the TCP/IP
protocol suite has become the foundation for the set of
technologies that form the basis of the Internet. The convergence
of IBM mainframe capabilities with Internet technology,
connectivity, and standards (particularly TCP/IP) is dramatically
changing the face of information technology and driving
requirements for ever more secure, scalable, and highly available
mainframe TCP/IP implementations.The IBM z/OS Communications Server TCP/IP Implementation series
provides understandable, step-by-step guidance about how to enable
the most commonly used and important functions of z/OS
Communications Server TCP/IP.This IBM Redbooks® publication is for people who install and
support z/OS Communications Server. It explains how to set up
security for your z/OS networking environment. With the advent of
TCP/IP and the Internet, network security requirements have become
more stringent and complex. Because many transactions are from
unknown users and untrusted networks such as the Internet, careful
attention must be given to host and user authentication, data
privacy, data origin authentication, and data integrity. Also,
because security technologies are complex and can be confusing, we
include helpful tutorial information in the appendixes of this
book.For more information about z/OS Communications Server base
functions, standard applications, and high availability, see the
other following volumes in the series:, SG24-8360IBM z/OS V2R2

Create your own sophisticated applications to analyze and display geospatial information using QGIS and PythonAbout This VideoExperience the speed and agility of QGIS and Python by building sophisticated geospatial applicationsDiscover how the QGIS Python API can be used to display information on a mapLearn how to build a complete and sophisticated turnkey mapping application using the PyQGIS libraryIn DetailUsing the more advanced aspects of the QGIS geographical information system, this video course shows how to build sophisticated geospatial applications using Python. Geospatial applications are often very complicated; using QGIS, however, you can avoid a lot of this complexity by developing at a higher level, making use of the many viewing tools and analyzing and editing geospatial data provided by the QGIS system. Using these tools, you can build more sophisticated geospatial applications with less time and effort.The course starts with an in-depth look at the QGIS Python API, concentrating on how this library can be used to display information on a map. We then look at how external applications that use the PyQGIS library can let the user select and edit geospatial features. We go on to use the knowledge we have gained to implement a sophisticated turnkey mapping system called ForestTrails. This application includes the ability to add, edit, and delete “tracks” on top of a detailed basemap, and lets you find the shortest path between two points by following the network of tracks. This example will serve as a springboard for the user’s own developmental efforts, as well as being a complete and very useful program in its own right.

Manage your schedule more effectively using Calendar and Reminders!In the days before personal computers and mobile devices, we had to rely on paper calendars and to-do lists to help us organize our time and activities. Now, we have powerful tools, like Apple's Calendar and Reminders, that are much more responsive to our needs. Put an event on your schedule, invite others to join, or set yourself an alarm (or more than one). Or, keep a list of to-do items, add to it and view it on all your Apple devices, and share your list with family or friends.In this book, veteran Mac journalist and editor Scholle McFarland will guide you through getting to know these incredibly helpful apps, including lesser-known (but handy) features. For example, did you know that in Calendar you can set an alert for when you need to leave for an event, based on the travel time calculated using the location you entered for the event? Or that Reminders can prompt you to do something not only at a certain time, but also once you've reached a specific destination, like the grocery store?If you've never taken the opportunity to explore Calendar and Reminders, this book will show you how to make them an important part of your daily routine. If you've already been using Calendar and Reminders, you'll learn how to use them more effectively, troubleshoot common problems, and delve deeper into their capabilities.Whip your schedule into shape and tame your to-do lists with Take Control of Calendar and Reminders!Let Scholle walk you through how to get the best out of Calendar and Reminders, including how to:Customize Calendar to your liking, from setting time zones, to color coding specific calendarsCreate events, making them repeat at regular intervals or on certain datesSet up notifications and alerts, so you never miss an eventInvite people to events, or share your calendar with themCreate, manage, and share lists in RemindersSet alarms in Reminders at a certain time or a certain placeUse Siri to save time when creating events or remindersEasily check events and reminders on your Mac, iPhone, or Apple WatchTroubleshoot common problems in Calendar and RemindersShare calendars and reminders using iCloud Family Sharing

AbstractBusiness Intelligence (BI) is a broad term that relates to
applications that analyze data to understand and act on the key
metrics that drive profitability in an enterprise. Key to analyzing
that data is providing fast, easy access to it while delivering it
in formats or tools that best fit the needs of the user.At the core of any BI solution are user query and reporting
tools that provide intuitive access to data supporting a spectrum
of users from executives to “power users,” from spreadsheet
aficionados to the external Internet consumer.IBM® DB2® Web Query for i offers a set of modernized tools for a
more robust, extensible, and productive reporting solution than the
popular IBM Query for System i® tool (also known as IBM Query/400).
IBM DB2 Web Query for i preserves investments in the reports that
are developed with Query/400 by offering a choice of importing
definitions into the new technology or continuing to run existing
Query/400 reports as is. But, it also offers significant
productivity and performance enhancements by leveraging the latest
in DB2 for i query optimization technology.The DB2 Web Query for i product is a web-based query and report
writing product that offers enhanced capabilities over the IBM
Query for iSeries product (also commonly known as Query/400). IBM
DB2 Web Query for i includes Query for iSeries technology to assist
customers in their transition to DB2 Web Query. It offers a more
modernized, Java based solution for a more robust, extensible, and
productive reporting solution.DB2 Web Query provides the ability to query or build reports
against data that is stored in DB2 for i (or Microsoft SQL Server)
databases through browser-based user interface
technologies:Build reports with ease through the web-based, ribbon-like
InfoAssist tool that leverages a common look and feel that can
extend the number of personnel that can generate their own
reports.Simplify the management of reports by significantly reducing the
number of report definitions that are required through the use of
parameter driven reports.Deliver data to users in many different formats, including
directly into spreadsheets, or in boardroom-quality PDF format, or
viewed from the browser in HTML.Leverage advanced reporting functions, such as matrix reporting,
ranking, color coding, drill-down, and font customization to
enhance the visualization of DB2 data.
DB2 Web Query offers features to import Query/400 definitions and
enhance their look and functions. By using it, you can add
OLAP-like slicing and dicing to the reports or view reports in
disconnected mode for users on the go.This IBM Redbooks® publication provides a broad understanding of
what can be done with the DB2 Web Query product. This publication
is a companion of DB2 Web Query Tutorials, SG24-8378, which has a

Design and build scalable systems with ScalaAbout This VideoExplore how to deploy and write performance tests for microservicesBuild a working application using Play FrameworkTest microservices and create logic that is non-blocking and asynchronousIn DetailMicroservices is an architectural style and pattern that is becoming hugely popular and is adopted by many organizations because of the advantages that it offers. It is an approach to building asynchronous, non-blocking, and failure-resilient applications.
This course focuses on building microservices in Scala. It addresses the best practices and common pitfalls in microservice architecture and useful implementation strategies in Scala. We start by shedding light on traditional monoliths, Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), and how microservices evolved from it. Next we move on to explain the Play framework and build a small but working application. You will understand the importance of writing code that is asynchronous and non-blocking and how Play helps us do this. Later, the video explains how to build Reactive microservices using Akka and Akka HTTP, which adhere to the principles underlying the Reactive Manifesto. Next, we explore building high-throughput and resilient applications in some detail. At the end of the video, we explore Lagom and how it incorporates best practices to avoid common pitfalls.
