Explore the practical side of REST to build data-centric applications with NodeAbout This VideoWork through a series of guidelines and best practices to efficiently design RESTful Web APIs with NodeUnderstand the structure of APIs, their authentication protocols, and their implementation toolsThis practical guide provides the knowledge you need to delve into the endless possibilities enabled by Big DataIn DetailRESTful Web APIs allow developers to create unprecedented applications by leveraging the data on the internet. Since JavaScript is the language of the web, building APIs using Node.js provides a seamless development experience on both the front end and the back end.This video course gives you an overview of a RESTful API and goes through the logical steps of building one. It explores three different APIs, focusing on their similarities and differences to effectively implement one.We’ll start off by defining APIs, showing you how they can be built on top of HTTP, and listing the properties that make an API RESTful. We will develop Twitter Notes, a web application that lets its users leave notes for their Twitter friends. We will use Twitter’s API to implement a login flow and then design a web API. In addition to using Twitter’s API, we will take a closer look at two other real-world APIs—Facebook API and GitHub API. Finally, we’ll look at some best practices to keep the APIs secure, maintainable, and performing.By the end of this course, you will have a good grasp of APIs, HTTP, REST, OAuth 1.0a, API testing, and site reliability, performance, and security. Since the course explores three different REST APIs, you will reach a level where you will be comfortable using any RESTful API, even if it does not have an SDK.

Let's learn about money! Money is a market phenomenon. It originated as a spontaneous social institution, and its use is still inextricably tied to market exchange. Therefore, the analysis of money occurs in a market setting. Use of monetary systems and a market setting as the underlying parameters ideally positions the reader to examine money in its various uses: as a medium of exchange, in credit markets, and as an instrument of monetary policy. Professor Gerdes believes that the study of money should commence at the most general level. Consequently, this book is anchored in the context of monetary systems (commodity, fiduciary, and fiat monies). This gives readers a very broad perspective-helping readers understand, for example, how the money used today differs from money used in the past, or how current money relates to money discovered by anthropologists in isolated subcultures. This book is perfect for courses in traditional money and banking courses, as well as undergraduate courses in monetary theory as well as sourcebook on money for business professionals.

A lot of courses will teach you how to make a video game. This course is different: instead of teaching you how to use a game development engine or do cool programming tricks, we'll talk about video games and the nature of fun. What this course is about is the nature of fun and the analytical thought processes successful game designers employ to make games that people really want to play.You'll learn how to use the MDA (Mechanics, Dynamics, and Aesthetics) framework to analyze different components of games; how to shape the stories that players tell themselves; and how gameplay design creates specific feelings in your players. By the end of the course, you'll come away with an appreciation for both high-level and low-level gameplay design decisions, plus an understanding of details like: why the blue shell in Mario Kart is more likely to appear when you're in last place, and how horror games are scary because of more than just the graphics. Understand why games are fun and exactly what we mean by fun Discover why certain games work and how to design for specific types of fun Explore games through the lens of the Mechanics-Dynamics-Aesthetics framework Understand how gameplay design shapes each player's internal narrativeJon Manning is a writer, teacher, and game developer.

The area of coalgebra has emerged within theoretical computer science with a unifying claim: to be the mathematics of computational dynamics. It combines ideas from the theory of dynamical systems and from the theory of state-based computation. Although still in its infancy, it is an active area of research that generates wide interest. Written by one of the founders of the field, this book acts as the first mature and accessible introduction to coalgebra. It provides clear mathematical explanations, with many examples and exercises involving deterministic and non-deterministic automata, transition systems, streams, Markov chains and weighted automata. The theory is expressed in the language of category theory, which provides the right abstraction to make the similarity and duality between algebra and coalgebra explicit, and which the reader is introduced to in a hands-on manner. The book will be useful to mathematicians and (theoretical) computer scientists and will also be of interest to mathematical physicists, biologists and economists.

Factorization algebras are local-to-global objects that play a role in classical and quantum field theory which is similar to the role of sheaves in geometry: they conveniently organize complicated information. Their local structure encompasses examples like associative and vertex algebras; in these examples, their global structure encompasses Hochschild homology and conformal blocks. In this first volume, the authors develop the theory of factorization algebras in depth, but with a focus upon examples exhibiting their use in field theory, such as the recovery of a vertex algebra from a chiral conformal field theory and a quantum group from Abelian Chern-Simons theory. Expositions of the relevant background in homological algebra, sheaves and functional analysis are also included, thus making this book ideal for researchers and graduates working at the interface between mathematics and physics.

Questions about modular representation theory of finite groups can often be reduced to elementary abelian subgroups. This is the first book to offer a detailed study of the representation theory of elementary abelian groups, bringing together information from many papers and journals, as well as unpublished research. Special attention is given to recent work on modules of constant Jordan type, and the methods involve producing and examining vector bundles on projective space and their Chern classes. Extensive background material is provided, which will help the reader to understand vector bundles and their Chern classes from an algebraic point of view, and to apply this to modular representation theory of elementary abelian groups. The final section, addressing problems and directions for future research, will also help to stimulate further developments in the subject. With no similar books on the market, this will be an invaluable resource for graduate students and researchers working in representation theory.

The augmentation of urban spaces with technology, commonly referred to as Media Architecture, has found increasing interest in the scientific community within the last few years. At the same time architects began to use digital media as a new material apart from concrete, glass or wood to create buildings and urban structures. Simultaneously, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) researchers began to exploit the interaction opportunities between users and buildings and to bridge the gaps between interface, information medium and architecture. As an example, they extended architectural structures with interactive, light-emitting elements on their outer shell, thereby transforming the surfaces of these structures into giant public screens. At the same time the wide distribution of mobile devices and the coverage of mobile internet allow manifold interaction opportunities between open data and citizens, thereby enabling the internet of things in the public domain. However, the appropriate distribution of information to all citizens is still cumbersome and a mutual dialogue not always successful (i.e. who gets what data and when?). In this book we therefore provide a deeper investigation of Using Information and Media as Construction Material with media architecture as an input and output medium.

The data structures in this book are primarily written in Scala, however implementing the algorithms in other functional languages should be straight forward.What You Will LearnLearn to think in the functional paradigmUnderstand common data structures and the associated algorithms, as well as the context in which they are commonly usedTake a look at the runtime and space complexities with the O notationSee how ADTs are implemented in a functional settingExplore the basic theme of immutability and persistent data structuresFind out how the internal algorithms are redesigned to exploit structural sharing, so that the persistent data structures perform well, avoiding needless copying.Get to know functional features like lazy evaluation and recursion used to implement efficient algorithmsGain Scala best practices and idiomsIn DetailFunctional data structures have the power to improve the codebase of an application and improve efficiency. With the advent of functional programming and with powerful functional languages such as Scala, Clojure and Elixir becoming part of important enterprise applications, functional data structures have gained an important place in the developer toolkit. Immutability is a cornerstone of functional programming. Immutable and persistent data structures are thread safe by definition and hence very appealing for writing robust concurrent programs.How do we express traditional algorithms in functional setting? Won't we end up copying too much? Do we trade performance for versioned data structures?This book attempts to answer these questions by looking at functional implementations of traditional algorithms.It begins with a refresher and consolidation of what functional programming is all about. Next, you'll get to know about Lists, the work horse data type for most functional languages. We show what structural sharing means and how it helps to make immutable data structures efficient and practical.Scala is the primary implementation languages for most of the examples. At times, we also present Clojure snippets to illustrate the underlying fundamental theme. While writing code, we use ADTs (abstract data types). Stacks, Queues, Trees and Graphs are all familiar ADTs. You will see how these ADTs are implemented in a functional setting. We look at implementation techniques like amortization and lazy evaluation to ensure efficiency.By the end of the book, you will be able to write efficient functional data structures and algorithms for your applications.Style and approachStep-by-step topics will help you get started with functional programming. Learn by doing with hands-on code snippets that give you practical experience of the subject.Downloading the example code for this book.

software into production more rapidly, with greater reliability.
A Practical Guide to Continuous Delivery is a 100% practical
guide to building Continuous Delivery pipelines that automate
rollouts, improve reproducibility, and dramatically reduce
risk.Eberhard Wolff introduces a proven Continuous Delivery
technology stack, including Docker, Chef, Vagrant, Jenkins,
Graphite, the ELK stack, JBehave, and Gatling. He guides you
through applying these technologies throughout build, continuous
integration, load testing, acceptance testing, and monitoring.
Wolff’s start-to-finish example projects offer the basis for
your own experimentation, pilot programs, and full-fledged
deployments.

A Practical Guide to Continuous Delivery is for everyone who
wants to introduce Continuous Delivery, with or without DevOps. For
managers, it introduces core processes, requirements, benefits, and
technical consequences. Developers, administrators, and architects
will gain essential skills for implementing and managing pipelines,
and for integrating Continuous Delivery smoothly into software
architectures and IT organizations.
