Content for titles in this program is made available throughout the development cycle, so products may not be complete, edited, or finalized, including video post-production editing.OverviewConfiguration of Cisco devices (e.g. routers and switches) has traditionally been performed at the command line. However, an industry-wide paradigm shift is now underway, where more and more configuration is being performed by software, an approach commonly referred to as Software Defined Networking (SDN). SDN is an emerging architecture that is makes it easier and more cost-effective to implement network policies and manage network resources. It does this by decoupling the network control from the network hardware (which continues to manage forwarding functions), allowing network control to become directly programmable and the underlying network infrastructure to be managed by applications and network services rather than individually configured.Network Programmability Fundamentals LiveLessons introduces the theory surrounding SDN networks and examines components found in a Cisco ACI network. Additionally, this course covers Python programming, a key skill required for network programmability. Finally, this course walks through multiple network programmability exercises, which can be performed (for free) at Cisco’s DevNet site.About the InstructorWith Cisco experience dating back to 1989, Kevin Wallace, CCIEx2 (Collaboration and R/S) #7945 has been a network design specialist for the Walt Disney World Resort, an instructor of Cisco courses for Skillsoft, and a network manager for Eastern Kentucky University.

 This course takes a different approach from most Java courses, using a story-like approach to teach concepts. Topics start by looking at a problem, considering how it might be solved, and steadily working to more advanced solutions, while building understanding of the concepts, libraries, and syntax being used. You will develop a thorough understanding of each chunk of knowledge, so you are ready to use that understanding in your daily coding.
 You will start by taking a look at generalization in collections and explore key collection API interfaces. You will then find out why there’s a need for generics, see general tools you can use, and take a look at some use cases. After that you will dive in, exploring investigating lists, array-based implementations of a list, linked implementation, and more. The next step is then understanding iterating collections, equality, orders, hash codes, and hashed storage before jumping into sets, trees, improving designs, maps, implementing the iterator pattern, the new functional methods added with Java 8, and more interfaces. You will then take a look at list implementations and utilities for collections. The course will wrap things up with a section on creating and combining comparators, which includes more functional additions to the APIs.About the InstructorSimon Roberts started his computing career as a programmer in the early 1980s and built several of his own microprocessor-based computers. He moved to Sun Microsystems, Inc. in mid-1995 and almost immediately became the lead Java instructor in the U.K. In 1998, Simon moved to Colorado, where he still lives. While at Sun, he created the Sun Certified Programmer, Developer, and Architect certifications, and worked in teams on several other certifications and subsequent revisions to those exams. He wrote three books on Java, including two certification study guides, one covering the Programmer and Developer exams, and one on the Architect exam. He left Sun in 2004 and became an independent instructor, architect, and software engineer.Skill LevelBeginner to IntermediateWho Should Take This Course
 This course will benefit intermediate and advanced level Java programmers looking to develop and solidify their understanding of the core Collections API, or looking to add the functional features that were added at Java 8 to their repertoire. Additionally, because the course investigates design issues and patterns in the context of the Collections API, anyone wishing to improve their grasp of how to apply patterns as part of their software engineering toolkit can benefit. The course also addresses all the Collections-related topics that are essential knowledge for Oracle’s Java Programmer certification (1Z0-809) for Java SE 8, and is of value to anyone preparing for that, or a similar exam.Course Requirements
 The primary intended audience has an intermediate knowledge of Java. In addition, software engineers who are transitioning to Java from a position of solid experience of another object-oriented programming language in the syntactic traditions of C/C++ should be able to gain full benefit from the course. For example, a candidate with a good knowledge of C# would benefit from this material, even if one does not have prior experience in Java.About LiveLessons Videos

In today’s digital age, online and mobile advertising are of growing importance, with advertising no longer bound to the traditional media industry. Although the advertising industry still has broader access to the different measures and channels, users and consumers today have more possibilities to publish, get informed or communicate – to “co-create” –, and to reach a bigger audience. There is a good chance thus that users and consumers are better informed about the objectives and persuasive tricks of the advertising industry than ever before. At the same time, advertisers can inform about products and services without the limitations of time and place faced by traditional mass media.But will there really be a time when advertisers and consumers have equal power, or does tracking users online and offline lead to a situation where advertisers have more information about the consumers than ever before? The volume discusses these questions and related issues.
