With Early Release ebooks, you get books in their earliest form—the author's raw and unedited content as he or she writes—so you can take advantage of these technologies long before the official release of these titles. You'll also receive updates when significant changes are made, new chapters are available, and the final ebook bundle is released.This practical book introduces systems programmers to Rust, the new and cutting-edge language. You’ll learn how Rust offers the rare and valuable combination of statically verified memory safety and low-level control—imagine C++, but without dangling pointers, null pointer dereferences, leaks, or buffer overruns.Author Jim Blandy—a former maintainer of GNU Emacs and GNU Guile—demonstrates how Rust has the potential to be the first usable programming language that brings the benefits of an expressive modern type system to systems programming. Rust’s rules for borrowing, mutability, ownership, and moves versus copies will be unfamiliar to most systems programmers, but they’re key to Rust’s unique advantages.This book presents Rust’s rules clearly and economically; elaborates on their consequences; and shows you how to express the programs you want to write in terms that Rust can prove are free of broad classes of everyday errors.

Design patterns allow developers to efficiently address common problems faced during developing applications.The focus in this course is on learning about concurrent structures and parallel execution. You will use the majority of Go primitives to write concurrent apps, and we will develop some classical design patterns with concurrent structures to maximize parallelism. Also, you will learn some typical structures with which to develop concurrent apps in Go. You will learn how a classical pattern can become more complex if you need it to work in a concurrent way; however, the idea is to understand Go concurrent primitives so that you know how to write your own concurrent design patterns by using the knowledge taken from the course.

The impact is undeniable and yet with all the material available it still isn’t always easy to grok.This course delivers the building blocks of the functional paradigm in a way that makes sense to JavaScript developers. Animated visualizations help explain difficult concepts such as higher-order functions, lenses and persistent data, partial application and currying and then write code so you understand concepts before trying to apply the knowledge them.Many functional programming videos leave students feeling as if they just learned something that can’t quite be useful, but in Foundations of Functional Programming you’ll build stateless UI components and implement your own higher-order functions that integrate them with JSX and virtual-dom using no frameworks, just functional programming and modern JavaScript.

When CEOs think about the supply chain, it's usually to cut costs. But the smartest leaders see supply chain and sourcing for what they can be: hidden tools for outperforming the competition. Steve Jobs, upon returning to Apple in 1997, focused on transforming the supply chain. He hired Tim Cook—and the company sped up the development of new products, getting them into consumers' hands faster. The rest is history.Across a range of industries, once-leading companies are in trouble: Walmart, IBM, Pfizer, HP, and The Gap to name a few. But others thrive. While competitors were shutting stores, Zara's highly responsive supply chain made it the most valued company in the retail space and its founder, the richest man in Europe. The success of TJX, Amazon, Starbucks, and Airbus, is fueled by supply chain and sourcing. Showcasing real solutions, The Supply Chain Revolution will:Improve customer satisfaction and increase revenueMake alliances more successfulSimplify and debottleneck the supply chainBoost retail success by managing store investmentDrive excellenceTechnology is disrupting business models. Strategies must change. The Supply Chain Revolution flips conventional thinking and offers a powerful way for companies to compete in challenging times.

The cost benefit technique is so often referenced in government policy that a correct understanding is necessary for officials entrusted with public decisions. This book presents essential elements for understanding, interpreting, and conducting cost benefit analysis (CBA) in the context of local government. If you&#8217;re charged with preparing numerical analyses to assess the worthiness of a specific policy proposal, you&#8217;ll need this book to understand how costs and benefits are identified and analyzed in terms of economic efficiency and resource allocation. CBA is rooted in and has little or no value apart from the economic concepts of cost and resource efficiency. This book is designed to teach the correct use and interpretation of cost benefit analysis, while advising you of CBA&#8217;s limitations and pitfalls. Case studies, presented in the final chapters of this book, represent typical proposals confronted by local officials. The book also includes instructions for using computer spreadsheets to build basic cost benefit models and an appendix on the step-by-step process of discounting future costs and benefits.

Stop Holding Yourself Back—It's Time to Go Ask!The strongest relationships, top sales groups, and most successful organizations have one thing in common: people who have the courage to ask outrageously.

Based on Linda Swindling's original research and her experience helping people make high-stakes requests in everything from business negotiations to marriage proposals, this book offers proven approaches to improve your asking and boost your chances of success. Whether you are a professional looking for a bigger opportunity, an entrepreneur striving to build a company, a nonprofit seeking funding, or simply a parent or friend wanting a more fulfilling relationship, it's time to make that big ask!

With Early Release ebooks, you get books in their earliest form—the author's raw and unedited content as he or she writes—so you can take advantage of these technologies long before the official release of these titles. You’ll also receive updates when significant changes are made, new chapters are available, and the final ebook bundle is released.Streaming data is a big deal in big data these days, and for good reason. Businesses crave ever more timely data, and streaming is a good way to achieve lower latency. Plus, streaming is a much easier way to tame the massive, unbounded data sets that are increasingly common today.Expanded from co-author Tyler Akidau’s popular series of blog posts "Streaming 101" and "Streaming 102", this practical book shows data engineers, data scientists, and developers how to work with streaming or event-time data in a conceptual and platform-agnostic way. You’ll go from "101"-level understanding of stream processing to a nuanced grasp of the what, where, when, and how of processing real-time data streams.Dive deep into topics including watermarks and windowing, as well as state and timers in the context of stream processing. Although the book uses Apache Beam code snippets to make examples concrete, it presents a general and broad explanation of streaming that's not tied to a specific framework.

Praise for RESULTS AT THE TOP"Results at the Top is full of stories and examples of male leaders accepting accountability for greater gender diversity in their companies. What's different? They're not doing it out of compliance, but out of a personal commitment to advancing women in leadership." — Johan Bjorklund, Vice President and General Manager, Ericsson North America "Barbara and Richard help envision an achievable future where gender-intelligent leaders and advocates will unleash 100 percent of the world's human capital and create the future we all cherish. For the common good of human wellbeing, it's up to us to begin working together, NOW!" — Woody Buckner, Chair and CEO, Buckner and Company "The evidence is overwhelmingly clear—gender diversity at the senior leadership level correlates with greater business performance. Yet the number of women leaders remains very low and is truly unacceptable. Results at the Top is extremely valuable in providing new paradigms and actions to close this gap." — Bob Cancalosi, GE Director of Customer Leadership Education "The male leaders featured in Results at the Top are true change makers who realize that gender equality relies as much on men as it does women. Annis and Nesbitt provide an important new contribution to understanding how genuinely to change future outcomes for women. Their solid advice can help to drive diversity goals and accelerate progress in boardrooms and executive suites around the world." — Kathleen Taylor, Former President and CEO, Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts "I wish I had read Results at the Top and become more gender-intelligent much earlier in my career. Luckily, it is never too late to learn. This book provides business leaders deep insights and opportunities for creating value through high performing, gender balanced organizations." — Lars Terney, Partner, Nordic Capital "Annis and Nesbitt focus their lens on the unconscious biases that exists in the systems, procedures, and policies guiding our companies today. Fascinating revelations and common sense solutions makes Results at the Top a must read for any leader hoping to succeed in this changing business landscape." — Lara Warner, Chief Compliance and Regulatory Affairs Officer, Credit Suisse Group AG

This is the Rough Cut version of the printed
book.The attacks that the average sysadmin faces
today are the sophisticated nation-state attacks from the year
before. The early chapters of Linux Hardening in Hostile
Networks take a user-centric approach and walk the reader
through improving their operational security and hardening their
own workstation including a full guide on the security-focused
Tails and Qubes OSes. The core of the book aims at securing the
servers these users talk to, and guides the reader through how to
set up secured versions of the services your average sysadmin
manages every day, including web, email, and database servers that
communicate over TLS, locked-down DNS servers with DNSSEC. The book
also includes sections on Tor servers and hidden services.
Additional topics include workstation security, network, web
servers, email, DNS, and database.The book itself organizes each of these
categories into their own chapters, and each chapter is further
divided into three sections that organize tips for each category
based on difficulty level, time commitment, and overall threat.
While the first section of each chapter contains tips just about
anyone could follow in a few minutes to protect against the
entry-level hacker, the second section of the chapter aims at
intermediate, up to advanced, sysadmin and protecting against more
sophisticated, knowledgeable attackers. The final section of each
chapter describes techniques for advanced administrators to protect
against nation-state-level adversaries.

An increasing amount of research is being done in the area where technology and humans meet. The success or failure of technologies, the question whether technology helps humans to fulfill their goals or whether it hinders them is in most cases not a technical one. Even though this problem has been recognized in many academic disciplines that deal with technology, we are still far from being able to present a set of theories that would allow us to understand the interaction of technology and humans and to put it to practical use. The International Journal of Technology and Human Interaction (IJTHI) aims to provide a platform for leading research that addresses issues of human and technology interaction. IJTHI seeks original contributions concerning any aspect of technology and human interaction dealing with the development, usage, failure, success, policies, strategies, and applications of them. The journal invites contributions from both scholars and practitioners involved in research, management, and the utilization of technology and human interaction.This issue contains the following articles:Infrastructure Profiles and Knowledge SharingA Smart System for Twitter Corpus Collection, Management and VisualizationA Proposal for UTAUT Model Extension in the Virtual Learning Environments use as Presential Learning Support ContextSentiment Analysis with Text Mining in Contexts of Big Data

When photographing people, you can have a great composition, perfect light, and the right camera settings, but if your subject doesn’t look right—if the pose is off—the shot will not be a keeper. Posing is truly a crucial skill that photographers need to have in order to create great photographs. If you’re looking to improve your ability to pose your subjects—whether they’re men, women, couples, or groups—best-selling author and photographer Lindsay Adler’s The Photographer’s Guide to Posing: Techniques to Flatter Everyone is the perfect resource for you.In the first half of The Photographer’s Guide to Posing, Lindsay discusses how the camera sees, and thus how camera angle, lens choice, and perspective all affect the appearance of your subject. Lindsay then covers the five most important things that ruin a pose—such as placement of the hands, and your subject’s expression and posture. If you can look out for and avoid these five things, your skills (and your images) will quickly improve. Next, Lindsay dives into “posing essentials,” outlining her approach to start with a “base pose,” then build on that to create endless posing opportunities. She also discusses posing the face—with specific sections dedicated to the chin, jaw, eyes, and forehead—as well as posing hands.In the second half of the book, Lindsay dedicates entire chapters to posing specific subject matter: women, men, couples, curvy women, families and small groups, and large groups. In each chapter, Lindsay addresses that subject matter’s specific challenges, provides five “go-to poses” you can always use, and covers how to train the eye to determine the best pose for your subject(s). In the final chapter of the book, Lindsay brings it all together as she teaches you how to analyze a pose so that you can create endless posing opportunities and continuously improve your work

John Naisbitt, in his book, Global Paradox, says "the bigger the world economy, the more powerful its smaller players." Big international companies are deconstructing themselves and creating new structures to survive in the new world order. Concepts like reengineering, rightsizing, network organizations and the virtual corporation are fast becoming the common theme in business practice. International strategic alliances are also on the increase based on the notion that no single company and no single country can alone be a successful player in the new global game. The organizational applications and managerial implications of these technology resources warrant a forum for the discussion of these issues. The Journal of Global Information Management (JGIM) has an important role to play in providing such a forum for researchers and practitioners to share leading-edge knowledge in the global information resource management area.This issue contains the following articles:Diminution of Impediments in Implementation of Supply Chain Management Information System for Enhancing its Effectiveness in Indian Automobile IndustryFactors Affecting Individual Level ERP Assimilation in a Social Network Perspective: A Multi-Case StudyEffective Communication among Globally Distributed Software Development Teams: Development of an “Effective Communication” ScaleKnowledge Transfer, Knowledge-Based Resources, and Capabilities in E-Commerce Software ProjectsTesting Robustness of UTAUT Model: An Invariance AnalysisThe Impact of the Internet on Values in India: Shifts in Self-Enhancement and Self-Transcendence Amongst Indian YouthRegional Corporate Culture, Motivation and Technology Impacts on Performance of Quality Certified Firms: A Malaysian Perspective

This book is born of my desire to summon us to be leaders for this time as things fall apart, to reclaim leadership as a noble profession that creates possibility and humaneness in the midst of increasing fear and turmoil.  I know it is possible for leaders to use their power and influence, their insight and compassion, to lead people back to an understanding of who we are as human beings, to create the conditions for our basic human qualities of generosity, contribution, community and love to be evoked no matter what. I know it is possible to experience grace and joy in the midst of tragedy and loss.  I know it is possible to create islands of sanity in the midst of wildly disruptive seas.  I know it is possible because I have worked with leaders over many years in places that knew chaos and breakdown long before this moment.

Ask any teacher at any level of education – technology engages learners and animates their imagination. Technology stimulates minds in ways that make a profound and lasting difference. Indeed, technology, for many, is the most important new teaching strategy and learning style introduced in the past 50 years. Yet, the discipline is woefully lax in quantifiable and qualitative validation of successful learning outcomes. Learners with basic skills in reading, writing, and arithmetic master those skills better and faster with technology; yet the research is not there to defend how much better or how much faster these skills are acquired. Technology offers educators a way to adapt instruction to the needs of more diverse learners; still, such successes are not generalized across populations or content areas. Learners use technology to acquire and organize information evidence to obtain a higher level of comprehension; but we are not sure why. The purpose of the International Journal of Information and Communication Technology Education (IJICTE) is to grow this body of research, propose new applications of technology for teaching and learning, and document those practices that contribute irrefutable verification of information technology education as a discipline.This issue contains the following articles:Educational Online Technologies in Blended Tertiary Environments: Experts' PerspectivesStudent Responses to an ICT-Based E-Assessment Application for the Teaching Practicum/ Teaching Practice MODULEInfluencing Factors for Adopting Technology Enhanced Learning in the Medical Schools of Punjab, PakistanAn Investigation of Educational Use of Information and Communication Technology from the Perspectives of Ghanaian StudentsNew Literacy Implementation: The Impact of Professional Development on Middle School Student Science LearningPracticum-Based Approach to Bridge Between Information-Systems Industry Expectations and Graduates QualificationsMOOC and Blended Learning Models: Analysis from a Stakeholders' Perspective

The proliferation of Web-based technologies during the last decade may have given the impression of wide-spread changes in educational practices. In fact, we have only begun to scratch the surface of experiencing the vast impact these technologies could have on education. Viewed separately, Web-based technologies offer exciting possibilities for expanding the capacity to provide access to instruction and knowledge world-wide. However, and perhaps more importantly, viewing these technological advancements in a more dynamic context, forces educators and researchers to rethink the fundamental processes of teaching and learning . It's not just a simple matter of using a technical tool to supply time and place ubiquity but to accept the challenge of understanding the implications for the entire educational spectrum. Web-based teaching and learning begs the question of what exactly these technologies means for learners, teachers, program designers, academic experts, technical and administrative staff, institutional decision makers, training managers, publishers, and others. Although a considerable amount of exploration has been conducted regarding web-based learning technologies, the breadth and scope for dialogue and experimentation needs to be broadened. International Journal of Web-Based Learning and Teaching Technologies (IJWLTT) provides a place for the dialogue and support of a diverse community interested in taking the challenge further.This issue contains the following articles:Understanding the Use of Twitter for Teaching Purposes in Saudi Arabian UniversitiesA Low-Cost Wireless Multi-Presentation on Single Screen in Classroom Using Raspberry PiThe Parental Perspective over the Use of iPads in Primary and Middle Years of Schooling: Issues for Pedagogical and Policy DebatesInterpreting Experiences of Teachers Using Online Technologies to Interact with Teachers in Blended Tertiary Environments: A Phenomenological Study

With Early Release ebooks, you get books in their earliest form—the author's raw and unedited content as he or she writes—so you can take advantage of these technologies long before the official release of these titles. You’ll also receive updates when significant changes are made, new chapters are available, and the final ebook bundle is released.Without established design patterns to guide them, developers have had to build distributed systems from scratch, and most of these systems are very unique indeed. Now the increasing use of containers has paved the way for core distributed system patterns and re-usable containerized components. This practical guide presents a collection of repeatable, generic patterns to help make the development of reliable distributed systems far more approachable and efficient.Author Brendan Burns—Director of Engineering at Microsoft Azure—demonstrates how you can adapt existing software design patterns to designing and building reliable distributed applications. Systems engineers and application developers will learn how these long-established patterns provide a common language and framework for dramatically increasing the quality of your system.Understand how patterns and re-usable components enable the rapid development of reliable distributed systemsUse the side-car, adapter, and ambassador patterns to split your application into a group of containers on a single machineExplore loosely coupled multi-node distributed patterns for replication, scaling, and communication between the componentsLearn distributed system patterns for large-scale batch data processing, and for covering work-queues, event-based processing, and coordinated workflows

Without light, there is no photograph. As almost every photographer knows, the word “photograph” has its roots in two Greek words that, together, mean “drawing with light.” But what is less commonly acknowledged and understood is the role that shadow plays in creating striking, expressive imagery, especially in portraiture. It is through deft, nuanced use of both light and shadow that you can move beyond shooting simply ordinary, competent headshots into the realm of creating dramatic portraiture that can so powerfully convey a subject’s inner essence, communicate a personal narrative, and express your photographic vision.In The Dramatic Portrait: The Art of Crafting Light and Shadow, Chris Knight addresses portraiture with a unique approach to both light and shadow that allows you to improve and elevate your own portraiture. He begins with the history of portraiture, from the early work of Egyptians and Greeks to the sublime treatment of light and subject by artists such as Caravaggio, Rembrandt, and Vermeer. Chris then dives into a deep, hands-on exploration of light, shadow, and portraiture, offering numerous lessons and takeaways. He covers:• The qualities of light: hard, soft, and the spectrum in between• The relationships between light, subject, and background, and how to control them• Lighting patterns such as Paramount, Rembrandt, loop, and split• Lighting ratios and how they affect contrast in your image• Equipment: from big and small modifiers to grids, snoots, barn doors, flags, and gels• Multiple setups for portrait shoots, including those that utilize one, two, and three lights• How color contributes to drama and mood, eliciting an emotional response from the viewer• How to approach styling your portrait, from wardrobe to background• The post-processing workflow, including developing the RAW file, maximizing contrast, color grading, retouching, and dodging and burning for heightened drama and effect• How all of these elements culminate to help you define your personal style and create your own narrative

The books is a hands-on resource for family offices and those investors interested in generating returns through private company ownership to be more effective in creating returns in a complex market. Direct investing best practices are explored in-depth, with guidance on strategy and the evaluation and assessment of various investment opportunities. The process begins with a codified and specific investment goal, and a robust strategy tailored to the investor's individual needs. Useful insight on 'narrowing the field' helps investors select the appropriate opportunities to meet their investment goals, and practical tools help streamline the process of capital deployment and in turn providing more opportunities to achieve desired returns. Despite the growing interest in direct investing, there is little public information available to investors and there is a lack of transparency into practical standards. This book bridges the gap between strategy and execution, with comprehensive guidance and real-world insights. Define and craft a focused investment thesis and appropriate timeline specific to your needsIdentify the right type, size, duration, and risk profile aligned to your investment objectivesGain perspective on real-world direct investing and a deeper understanding of the risks and rewardsBetter understand best practices and institutional investment rigor to develop bespoke processes and policies that create better outcomes for independent investorsHistorically, extraordinary wealth has been created through equity in privately-held enterprise. Today, family offices and direct investors are looking more and more toward large capital deployment in early-stage and growth-oriented private equity investments, but are constrained by a lack of informed, established practices. The Complete Direct Investing Handbook provides the much-needed guidance and tools that can improve direct investment outcomes.

SummaryRx.NET in Action teaches developers how to build
event-driven applications using the Reactive Extensions (Rx)
library.About the TechnologyModern applications must react to streams of data such as user
and system events, internal messages, and sensor input. Reactive
Extensions (Rx) is a .NET library containing more than 600
operators that you can compose together to build reactive client-
and server-side applications to handle events asynchronously in a
way that maximizes responsiveness, resiliency, and elasticity.About the BookRx.NET in Action teaches developers how to build
event-driven applications using the Rx library. Starting with an
overview of the design and architecture of Rx-based reactive
applications, you�ll get hands-on with in-depth code examples to
discover firsthand how to exploit the rich query capabilities that
Rx provides and the Rx concurrency model that allows you to control
both the asynchronicity of your code and the processing of event
handlers. You�ll also learn about consuming event streams, using
schedulers to manage time, and working with Rx operators to filter,
transform, and group events.What�s InsideIntroduction to Rx in C#Creating and consuming streams of data and eventsBuilding complex queries on event streamsError handling and testing Rx codeAbout the ReaderReaders should understand OOP concepts and be comfortable coding

As exemplified by Apple and Google, maximizing the wealth of organizations involves what Joseph Schumpeter described as &#8220;creative destruction.&#8221; This occurs when scientific or technological breakthroughs lead to the launch of a radically new product or service at a time when there often is little or no evidence of the existence of an identified market opportunity. The world is currently involved in the third Industrial Revolution and academic research and real-world case studies have validated the fact that the management of technology-driven entrepreneurship is a somewhat different process to that of market-driven entrepreneurship. The existence of these differences generates the perspective that benefit exists in identifying managerial guidelines that can be of assistance in ensuring the success of technological entrepreneurship projects in both start-ups and existing businesses. Hence the aim of this text is to draw upon academic theory and real-world case materials as the basis for defining 86 key managerial guidelines for optimizing the outcome from involvement in technological entrepreneurship.

There is today a pronounced and accelerated convergence in architecture. This convergence is occurring by doers not thinkers; in practice not academia; in building design, fabrication, and construction. It is about solution-centric individuals engaged in real time problem solving, not in abstractions. The nature of this convergence, where things are converging and what that means for architecture, is the subject of this book. – from the IntroductionThose working in architecture and engineering feel pressure to work faster, at lower cost, while maintaining a high level of innovation and quality. At the same time, emergent tools and processes make this possible. Convergence is about the firms, teams and people who thrive in this environment as a result of their ability to creatively combine and innovate. It seeks to answer several timely questions: What are the tools and work processes that are converging? How are individuals and organizations converging their tools and work processes? What challenges and benefits are they seeing? What is the ultimate endgame of this convergence? What skillsets and mindsets would someone need to develop to work effectively in this changing environment? What are the implications of convergence on the role of the designer, and on design? On how we design, build, fabricate, and construct? On how we work?The book explains how convergence relates to, but ultimately differs from integration, consolidation, multi-tasking, automation, and other forms of optimization. The practice-based research builds upon the author’s research in BIM and in the collaborative leveraging of data in design and fabrication. As an investigation and meditation on the impact of technology on the education and making of design professionals Convergence explains what is happening in the world of design, and discusses the implications for the future of education, training and practice.

UsingXamarin, it is now easier than ever to have a unified code base that can be used for allof the major mobile platforms and it allows the developer to have more freedom andcontrol on how to create their game as opposed to other available engines. One of the main challenges is creating code that needs to perform the same functionalitybut differs for each different platform. This project will show the reader how to utiliseshared projects in Visual Studio to create classes that will perform this functionality.Another difficulty is the loading of assets which need to be saved in different locations foreach platform - this course will show the reader how to create code that will retrieveassets from different locations based on which platform is currently being targeted. Thecourse will also show how to create a game from start to finish and how to overcome anyobstacles that can arise during development. There will be 3 main stages to the course - creating the engine, creating the game, andthe final touches before releasing. The creating the engine stage will walk the viewerthrough creating a simple cross platform renderer for 2D games, as well as a way ofhandling audio and basic state system. The next stage will then create a 2D platformerstarting with designing the game to implementing all the character’s movements andenemy interactions as well as a simple menu system. The final stage will then show theviewer how to monetise their app and add analytics and achievements/leaderboardsbefore showing how to release the game on both app stores

Ask any teacher at any level of education – technology engages learners and animates their imagination. Technology stimulates minds in ways that make a profound and lasting difference. Indeed, technology, for many, is the most important new teaching strategy and learning style introduced in the past 50 years. Yet, the discipline is woefully lax in quantifiable and qualitative validation of successful learning outcomes. Learners with basic skills in reading, writing, and arithmetic master those skills better and faster with technology; yet the research is not there to defend how much better or how much faster these skills are acquired. Technology offers educators a way to adapt instruction to the needs of more diverse learners; still, such successes are not generalized across populations or content areas. Learners use technology to acquire and organize information evidence to obtain a higher level of comprehension; but we are not sure why. The purpose of the International Journal of Information and Communication Technology Education (IJICTE) is to grow this body of research, propose new applications of technology for teaching and learning, and document those practices that contribute irrefutable verification of information technology education as a discipline.This issue contains the following articles:Discovering the Two-Step Lag Behavioral Patterns of Learners in the College SPOC PlatformFactors Affecting University Students' Use of Moodle: An Empirical Study Based on TAMOnline Learning Tools for Middle School Science: Lessons Learned from a Design-Based Research ProjectRole of Enhancing Visual Effects Education Delivery to Encounter Career Challenges in MalaysiaStudents' Learning in Asynchronous Discussion Forums: A Meta-AnalysisAdvantages and Disadvantages of Clicker Use in EducationDigital Storytelling: An Alternative Way of Expressing Oneself

An increasing amount of research is being done in the area where technology and humans meet. The success or failure of technologies, the question whether technology helps humans to fulfill their goals or whether it hinders them is in most cases not a technical one. Even though this problem has been recognized in many academic disciplines that deal with technology, we are still far from being able to present a set of theories that would allow us to understand the interaction of technology and humans and to put it to practical use. The International Journal of Technology and Human Interaction (IJTHI) aims to provide a platform for leading research that addresses issues of human and technology interaction. IJTHI seeks original contributions concerning any aspect of technology and human interaction dealing with the development, usage, failure, success, policies, strategies, and applications of them. The journal invites contributions from both scholars and practitioners involved in research, management, and the utilization of technology and human interaction.This issue contains the following articles:Impact of E-Core Service Quality Dimensions on Perceived Value of M-Banking in Case of Three Socio-Economic VariablesExploring the Choice for Default SystemsUser-Friendly Security Patterns for Designing Social Network WebsitesBehavioral Intention of Using Social Networking Site: A Comparative Study of Taiwanese and Thai Facebook UsersAlternative Review Screen Design for Electronic Voting SystemsQuality and Acceptance of Crowdsourced Translation of Web Content

Meet the twelve people that can accelerate your success – in business and in lifeIt's Who You Know is the long-awaited handbook to effective, productive and influential networking. Having the right relationships is more important than ever before, but digital connectivity and social media has changed the landscape. Social media has made networking easy, but has it made it better? In an age of digital disconnect, having the right relationships is more important than ever before with more and more of us reporting we feel disconnected from social media. Networking is no longer about collecting business cards and meeting thousands of people online or offline; it's about knowing the right people, and nurturing those relationships. You only need 12 – or even just four. Approached strategically, this comparatively small network will provide the strength, diversity and opportunities to help you achieve your personal and professional goals. This book shows you who you need to know, how to get to know them and how to make value a two-way street. Action plans, checklists and an online diagnostic tool help you start taking steps right away, and the emphasis on "doing" over endless planning gives you the motivation you need to get up and go. The old adage "It's not what you know; it's who you know" has never been more applicable than it is today. The problem is that many of us "know" thousands of people across social networks, but how many of those people truly know you and how many of them are truly connected to you? It's time to clear out the network clutter and identify those who actually add value to your professional and personal development. Master the art of real and influential strategic networking in a noisy and disconnected online worldLearn who you need in your circle, and how to find themNurture and maintain your professional relationshipsLeverage your power network to accelerate your careerToday, jobs are filled before they're advertised and previously unthought-of collaborations appear out of nowhere. Networking has become a critical factor for success. It's Who You Know brings networking into the modern era, and shows you a strategic approach to making it work for you.

The primary objective of the International Journal of Decision Support System Technology (IJDSST) is to provide comprehensive coverage for DMSS technology issues. The issues can involve, among other things, new hardware and software for DMSS, new models to deliver decision making support, dialog management between the user and system, data and model base management within the system, output display and presentation, DMSS operations, and DMSS technology management. Since the technology's purpose is to improve decision making, the articles are expected to link DMSS technology to improvements in the process and outcomes of the decision making process. Decision Making Support Systems (DMSS) are information systems that interactively support the decision making process of individuals and groups in life, public, and private organizations, and other entities. These systems include Decision Support Systems (DSS), Executive Information Systems (EIS), Executive Support systems (ESS), Management Support Systems (MSS), Knowledge Based Systems (KBS), Intelligent Decision Support Systems (IDSS) and Creativity Enhancing Systems (CES). A theme that all articles published in the IJDSST have in common is to define new technologies in support of decision making. These technologies can be developed from several points of view: methodological, theoretical or technical. Each DMSS is a vehicle that delivers effectively and efficiently information technology and decision technology to the system user at a local or networked workstation or online through the Internet. The areas addressed by published papers can be diverse, including but not limited to:architectures of DSS, functionalities, mathematical models ofproblem solving, algorithms, man-machine interface, methods or methodologies. Decision technology usually involves accounting, cognitive science, economic science, management science, statistical models, operational research models and multi-criteria analyses that describe the decision problem explicitly and provide algorithms and methodologies that generate recommended solutions. There are a number of excellent theoretical and applied scholarly journals that offer articles in many DMSS areas. None, however, have a primary focus on DMSS technology and its role in DMSS support for the decision making process. The IJDSST is the official journal publication of the Euro Working Group on Decision Support System (EWG-DSS) (https://ewgdss.wordpress.com/). Several special issues have been published from research conducted in this working group.This issue contains the following articles:Materialized View Selection Using Bumble Bee Mating OptimizationRequirement Paradigms to Implement the Software Projects in Agile Development Using Analytical Hierarchy ProcessMulticriteria Model to Sort Suppliers in a Brazilian Dairy IndustryAn Adaptive Neural Network for the Cost Estimation of E-Learning Projects in the United Kingdom
