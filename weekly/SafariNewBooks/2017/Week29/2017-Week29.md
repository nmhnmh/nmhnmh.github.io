As such, there is an extensive job market available to those who master its syntax. However, mastering a language as complex and vast as Java requires a developer to start with a solid programming foundation. This 12-hour course provides that foundation. Those who are looking to start a career in software development, or developers who are looking to increase their marketability by learning the nuts and bolts of Java, will benefit from taking this course. To start you on the “right track,” the course goes beyond basic syntax by including best practices and object-oriented programming idioms. In addition, the topics covered help prepare you for the Oracle Certified Associate, Java Programmer SE 8 exam (a certification which demonstrates to potential employers a fundamental level of proficiency with the language). However, do note that this course is just as appropriate for someone who is not interested in taking the exam. The course starts at the very beginning, teaching how to use the Java Eclipse IDE and the basic programming syntax, then moves through the language covering object-oriented programming and on through important modern Java concepts such as Lambdas. If you want to learn Java, this is the course for you!

Full of practical advice and real-world examples, this book is your action guide to making change happen in a meaningful way.

Not long ago everyone knew what the word “retirement” meant. The expectation was that you worked until age 65—and then coasted through your golden years courtesy of a comfortable nest egg.Today, when living to 90 is common, when savings are slim, when people work longer and change jobs frequently, clinging to an outdated concept of retirement gets you nowhere. The changes ahead require an incremental approach to planning—and you better begin now.The new After 50 Lifestyle calls for more than money: it demands conscious engagement, diverse interests, and the ability to adapt. How Do I Get There from Here? helps you plot your direction for the coming decades. The first step is to acknowledge where you are—reviewing your assets, both the tangible (e.g. finances, health, relationships) and intangible (e.g. unfulfilled ambitions and new intentions). Then self-reflective questions and exercises walk you through imagining your future, identifying skills you'll need, and preparing for inevitable twists and turns along the way.A retirement of nonstop leisure is not just unreachable, but for most, undesirable. How Do I Get There from Here? guides you toward a dynamic future...designed just for you.

The traditional manufacturing process for moving an idea from initial concept to finished product consists of several stages, each involving a different set of specialists. But not any longer. With this report, you’ll learn how today’s cloud-based computer-aided design (CAD) systems can unify multiple stages into a relatively seamless end-to-end process that reduces the product development cycle from years to weeks.Author Mike Barlow examines this new manufacturing paradigm through interviews with cloud-based CAD vendors, including Autodesk, Onshape, and PTC. You’ll also learn how specialty product manufacturers use new CAD systems for quick prototyping, iteration, and closer communication and collaboration among design, engineering, assembly, and manufacturing teams.The beauty of cloud-based CAD is that team members can review designs and collaborate in real time via Macs, PCs and mobile phones, rather than the expensive workstations and huge files associated with traditional CAD and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) systems.Get a copy of this report and discover how manufacturers now have the ability to develop innovative products much faster and far more efficiently than ever before.

AbstractThis edition applies to IBM® Spectrum Accelerate V11.5.4.IBM Spectrum Accelerate™, a member of IBM Spectrum Storage™, is
an agile, software-defined storage solution for enterprise and
cloud that builds on the customer-proven and mature IBM XIV®
storage software. The key characteristic of Spectrum Accelerate is
that it can be easily deployed and run on purpose-built or existing
hardware that is chosen by the customer.IBM Spectrum Accelerate enables rapid deployment of
high-performance and scalable block data storage infrastructure
over commodity hardware on-premises or off-premises.This IBM Redbooks® publication provides a broad understanding of
IBM Spectrum Accelerate. The book introduces Spectrum Accelerate
and describes planning and preparation that are essential for a
successful deployment of the solution. The deployment is described
through a step-by-step approach, by using a graphical user
interface (GUI) based method or a simple command-line interface
(CLI) based procedure.Chapters in this book describe the logical configuration of the
system, host support and business continuity functions, and
migration. Although it makes many references to the XIV storage
software, the book also emphasizes where IBM Spectrum Accelerate
differs from XIV.Finally, a substantial portion of the book is dedicated to
maintenance and troubleshooting to provide detailed guidance for
the customer support personnel.

Instead of the meticulous detail that the much larger two-volume set provides, Core Java(R) SE 9 for the Impatient provides a condensed treatment focusing on practical examples presented in bite-sized chunks.As with Java 8, modern Java idioms are no longer required and there is a much faster, easier pathway for learning Java. Horstmann quickly cuts to the chase without lecturing about the superiority of one paradigm over another or rehashing Java history. Given the size of the Java language and the scope of the new features introduced in Java 9, there is a great deal of new material to cover, but it is presented in small chunks organized so that you can quickly retrieve it when needed.This book covers all aspects of Java that a modern developer needs to know, including modularity, as well as the powerful lambda expressions that were introduced in Java 8. It will also tell you how to find out more about old-fashioned concepts that you might still see in legacy code, but won't dwell on them.

Make no mistake—Millennials matter. They are no longer those darn kids, mere children of the rainmakers and game changers. With Baby Boomers entering retirement, they aren’t even kids at all. Their ability to pursue their dreams will drive our economy, and their inability to do so could destroy it. In other words, if Millennials have a problem, then everyone has a problem.The Millennial Money Fix first examines the complex challenges facing this generation, targeting their lack of financial education in school and at home, the rising cost of education and resultant student loan debt, and the career-crushing labor environment.With candor and humor, it guides you through a lifetime of important concepts, including:Identifying honest and realistic goals.Selecting and paying for a college or graduate program.Mastering cash flow to jumpstart your life.Navigating the job landscape to do what you love.Planning for marriage, babies, and all that gushy stuff.Redefining retirement as your ability to do what you want.The Millennial Money Fix is about learning the reasons for your financial problems and the mechanics of your solutions, for yourself and those to come.

The Mood ElevatorTake Charge of Your Feelings, Become a Better YouWe all ride the Mood Elevator up and down every day. How well we do it impacts our relationship, our personal effectiveness, our career and our experience of life. Most people take that ride for granted and don't think it can be influenced. But what if we knew the right buttons to push to move to the top of the Mood Elevator. Wouldn't it be useful if there were proven ways to make visits to the lower floors less frequent and less intense? In this very practical guide, Larry Senn provides an operating manual to keep you out of the emotional basement. He shows how to recognize when you've become so accustomed to being stuck on a lower floor—depressed, stressed, anxious, judgmental—you don't even realize it and what to do to interrupt those negative thought patterns and start going up again. He urges us to cultivate mental attitudes like curiosity and gratitude that will keep us on the higher floors and explains how to quiet the mind and nurture positive thoughts without succumbing to Pollyannaish denial. And as someone who took up triathalons at the age of seventy, he speaks from experience when he emphasizes the inseparable connection between physical health and mental health. Through Senn's decades of work as a consultant, the Mood Elevator has been enthusiastically embraced by hundreds of thousands of people around the world. It symbolizes our moment-to-moment experience of life, encompassing a wide range of feelings. Together, these emotions play a major role in defining the quality of our lives and relationships and our effectiveness on the job. By sharing his work with a wider audience, Senn hopes to help all of us live life at our best.

The primary objective of the International Journal of Decision Support System Technology (IJDSST) is to provide comprehensive coverage for DMSS technology issues. The issues can involve, among other things, new hardware and software for DMSS, new models to deliver decision making support, dialog management between the user and system, data and model base management within the system, output display and presentation, DMSS operations, and DMSS technology management. Since the technology's purpose is to improve decision making, the articles are expected to link DMSS technology to improvements in the process and outcomes of the decision making process. Decision Making Support Systems (DMSS) are information systems that interactively support the decision making process of individuals and groups in life, public, and private organizations, and other entities. These systems include Decision Support Systems (DSS), Executive Information Systems (EIS), Executive Support systems (ESS), Management Support Systems (MSS), Knowledge Based Systems (KBS), Intelligent Decision Support Systems (IDSS) and Creativity Enhancing Systems (CES). A theme that all articles published in the IJDSST have in common is to define new technologies in support of decision making. These technologies can be developed from several points of view: methodological, theoretical or technical. Each DMSS is a vehicle that delivers effectively and efficiently information technology and decision technology to the system user at a local or networked workstation or online through the Internet. The areas addressed by published papers can be diverse, including but not limited to:architectures of DSS, functionalities, mathematical models ofproblem solving, algorithms, man-machine interface, methods or methodologies. Decision technology usually involves accounting, cognitive science, economic science, management science, statistical models, operational research models and multi-criteria analyses that describe the decision problem explicitly and provide algorithms and methodologies that generate recommended solutions. There are a number of excellent theoretical and applied scholarly journals that offer articles in many DMSS areas. None, however, have a primary focus on DMSS technology and its role in DMSS support for the decision making process. The IJDSST is the official journal publication of the Euro Working Group on Decision Support System (EWG-DSS) (https://ewgdss.wordpress.com/). Several special issues have been published from research conducted in this working group.This issue contains the following articles:A Recommender System Based on Multi-Criteria AggregationProposal for Measuring Quality of Decision Trees PartitionA Knowledge Network and Mobilisation Framework for Lean Supply Chain Decisions in Agri-Food IndustryA Decision Support System for Sustainable Waste Collection

An increasing amount of research is being done in the area where technology and humans meet. The success or failure of technologies, the question whether technology helps humans to fulfill their goals or whether it hinders them is in most cases not a technical one. Even though this problem has been recognized in many academic disciplines that deal with technology, we are still far from being able to present a set of theories that would allow us to understand the interaction of technology and humans and to put it to practical use. The International Journal of Technology and Human Interaction (IJTHI) aims to provide a platform for leading research that addresses issues of human and technology interaction. IJTHI seeks original contributions concerning any aspect of technology and human interaction dealing with the development, usage, failure, success, policies, strategies, and applications of them. It's worthy to note that this journal has been experiencing an augmenting rank via Scopus , and as such, our continued goal is to make a global impact in the research area of the interaction between humans and technology. We invite contributions from both scholars and practitioners involved in research, management, and the utilization of technology and human interaction.This issue contains the following articles:Information Management Through a Multidimensional Information Systems Architecture: A University of Trás-os-Montes e Alto Douro Case StudySimulator for Teaching Robotics, ROS and Autonomous Driving in a Competitive MindsetTeaching and Learning Modelling and Specification Based on Mobile Devices and Cloud: A Case StudyVirtual Reality Using Smart-Devices in Educational Frameworks: Case Study: Museum Casa BatllóNew Pedagogical Approaches with TechnologiesUsing Mobile Technologies in Education: A New Pedagogical Approach to Promote Reading Literacy

John Naisbitt, in his book, Global Paradox, says "the bigger the world economy, the more powerful its smaller players." Big international companies are deconstructing themselves and creating new structures to survive in the new world order. Concepts like reengineering, rightsizing, network organizations and the virtual corporation are fast becoming the common theme in business practice. International strategic alliances are also on the increase based on the notion that no single company and no single country can alone be a successful player in the new global game. The organizational applications and managerial implications of these technology resources warrant a forum for the discussion of these issues. The Journal of Global Information Management (JGIM) has an important role to play in providing such a forum for researchers and practitioners to share leading-edge knowledge in the global information resource management area.This issue contains the following articles:Multi-Agent based Production Management Decision System Modelling for the Textile EnterpriseChallenges Assessment for the E-Commerce Industry in India: A Review (With Special Reference to Flipkart V/S Snapdeal)Analysis of Consideration of Security Parameters by Vendors on Trust and Customer Satisfaction in E-CommerceRobust Watermarking of Polygonal Meshes Based on Vertex Norms Variance DistortionPerformance of Secured and Robust Watermarking Using Evolutionary Computing TechniqueRealization of a New Robust and Secure Watermarking Technique Using DC Coefficient Modification in Pixel Domain and Chaotic EncryptionMMAS Algorithm for Features Selection Using 1D-DWT for Video-Based Face Recognition in the Online Video Contextual Advertisement User-Oriented SystemEEECARP: Efficient Energy Clustering Adaptive Routing Procedure for Wireless Sensor Networks

Global markets and competition have forced companies to operate in a physically distributed environment to take the advantage of benefits of strategic alliances between partnering firms. Earlier, information systems such as Material Requirements Planning (MRP), Computer-Aided Design (CAD) and Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAM) have widely been used for functional integration within an organization. With global operations in place, there is a need for suitable Enterprise Information Systems (EIS) such as Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and E-Commerce (EC) for the integration of extended enterprises along the supply chain with the objective of achieving flexibility and responsiveness. Companies all over the world spend billions of dollars in the design and implementation of EIS in particular ERP systems such as Oracle, Peoplesoft, SAP, JD Edwards and BAAN with the objective of achieving an integrated global supply chain. Inter-organizational information systems play a major role in improving communication and integration between partnering firms to achieve an integrated global supply chain.
