The accelerating pace and diffusion of technological change has taken control of an ever-growing fraction of the world economy. This fraction is being assimilated into a different set of economic fundamentals, such as the rapid and exponential price deflation inherent to technology. The effect of this was insignificant until recently, but is now beginning to create conspicuous distortions in many economic metrics, and is just years from being the dominant force across the entire economy. In response to technological deflation, the central banks of the world will have to create new money in perpetuity, increasing the stream at an exponentially rising rate much higher than is currently assumed. This now-permanent need for monetary expansion, if embraced, can fund government spending more directly. This in turn creates a very robust, dynamic, and efficient safety net for citizens, while simultaneously reducing and even eliminating most forms of taxation by 2025. Failure to recognize that technological deflation mandates permanent and ever-rising central bank monetary expansion that can and should gradually become the primary source of government spending will precipitate a major financial crisis starting as soon as 2017.

Master a proven approach to create, implement, and sustain a data strategy.
Pervasive, data is a unique organizational resource, and this distinction warrants its own strategy. Data, representing your single non-depletable, non-degradable, durable strategic asset, is likely also your most poorly leveraged and underutilized organizational asset. 
Lack of talent, barriers in organizational thinking, and seven specific data sins prevent most organizations from benefiting fully from their data asset investments. Solving these prerequisites will allow your organization to:Improve your organization's data;
Improve the way your people use data; and
Improve the way your people use data to achieve your organizational strategy.

This method better focuses data and thinking in direct support of strategic objectives. After eliminating necessary prerequisites, organizations can develop a disciplined and repeatable means of improving their data, literacy, standards, and controls using data governance practices. Once in place, the process (based on the theory of constraints) becomes a variant of lather, rinse, and repeat. Several complementary concepts covered include:An overview of data strategy prerequisites;
A repeatable process for identifying and removing data constraints;
Why data strategy is necessary for effective data governance;
Balancing operational results with capability development;
An objective definition of data-centric thinking; and
Ways to monetize these efforts.

The Innovation CodeThe Creative Power of Constructive ConflictHarmony is sublime in music but deadly to innovation. The only way to create new, hybrid solutions is to clash. Innovation happens when we bring people with contrasting perspectives and complementary areas of expertise together in one room. We innovate best with people who challenge us, not people who agree with us. It sounds like a recipe for chaos and confusion. But in The Innovation Code, Jeff DeGraff, dubbed the “Dean of Innovation,” and Staney DeGraff introduce a simple framework to explain the ways different kinds of thinkers and leaders can create constructive conflict in any organization. This positive tension produces ingenious solutions that go far beyond “the best of both worlds.” Drawing on their work with nearly half of the Fortune 500 companies, the DeGraffs help you harness the creative energy that arises from opposing viewpoints. They identify four contrasting styles of innovator—the Artist, the Engineer, the Athlete, and the Sage—and include exercises and assessments for building, managing, and embracing the dynamic discord of a team that contains all four. You can also figure out where you fit on the continuum of innovator archetypes. Using vivid examples, The Innovation Code offers four steps to normalize conflict and channel it to develop something completely new. By following these simple steps, you will get breakthrough innovations that are both good for you and your customers. This is a rigorous but highly accessible guide for achieving breakthrough solutions by utilizing the full—and seemingly contradictory—spectrum of innovative thinking.

Improve your Java 9 programs using Functional techniquesAbout This VideoUnderstand the functional programming concepts and how it differs from OOPWrite easy and maintainable codes with the lambda expressions and streamsDiscover the new features of Java 9 which will help you apply FP techniques to your codeIn DetailJava 8 introduced a wealth of new features, pushing Java towards the so-called functional programming paradigm. Benefits from this shift include succinctness and ease of developing robust multi-threaded applications.In this course, we will introduce the key functional features of Java 8 and 9, and explain how they can be used to write code that is more expressive and easily amenable to parallelization.Specifically, we will first discuss lambda functions and functional interfaces. Using these features, programmers can easily create objects that offer a single specific service, similarly to anonymous classes. We will also explore the predefined functional interfaces that can be found in the Java API, starting from well-known pre-existing ones like Comparator and Runnable.Reaping the full benefits of lambda functions requires employing them with streams, a new kind of collection with built-in parallelization support. We will examine the relationship between streams and collections, and how the latter have changed as a result of the new language features.Finally, after having mastered the key features of streams, we will consider the details related to parallel execution, such as the crucial notion of side-effect and the fork-join execution model.

"Highly recommended for educators, parents, and moderate feminists who seek inspiration from one of the most accomplished women of this or any other age."—Publishers Weekly

The definitive biography of Maria Montessori—physician, feminist, social reformer, educator, and one of the most admired, influential, and controversial women of the twentieth century.
 
Maria Montessori effected a worldwide revolution in the classroom.  She developed a new method of educating the young and inspired a movement that carried it into every corner of the world.  This is the story of the woman behind the public figure—her accomplishments, her ideas, and her passions.

Montessori broke the mold imposed on women in the nineteenth century and forged a new one, first for herself and eventually for those who came after her.  Against formidable odds she became the first woman to graduate from the medical school of the University of Rome and then devoted herself to the condition of children considered uneducable at the time.  She developed a teaching method that enabled them to do as well as normal children, a method which then led her to found a new kind of school—the Casa dei Bambini, or House of Children—which gained her worldwide fame and still pervades classrooms wherever young children learn.

This biography is not only the story of a groundbreaking feminist but a vital chapter in the history of education.

Data scientists can make use of it in deriving meaningful insights that can be used by businesses to redefine or transform the way they operate. Lambda architecture is also emerging as one of the very eminent patterns in the big data landscape, as it not only helps to derive useful information from historical data but also correlates real-time data to enable business to take critical decisions. This book tries to bring these two important aspects — data lake and lambda architecture—together.This book is divided into three main sections. The first introduces you to the concept of data lakes, the importance of data lakes in enterprises, and getting you up-to-speed with the Lambda architecture. The second section delves into the principal components of building a data lake using the Lambda architecture. It introduces you to popular big data technologies such as Apache Hadoop, Spark, Sqoop, Flume, and ElasticSearch. The third section is a highly practical demonstration of putting it all together, and shows you how an enterprise data lake can be implemented, along with several real-world use-cases. It also shows you how other peripheral components can be added to the lake to make it more efficient.By the end of this book, you will be able to choose the right big data technologies using the lambda architectural patterns to build your enterprise data lake.Style and approachThe book takes a pragmatic approach, showing ways to leverage big data technologies and lambda architecture to build an enterprise-level data lake.Downloading the example code for this book.

The book is designed for both experienced C++ programmers as well as people with strong knowledge of OOP concepts.What You Will LearnGet to know about the new core language features and the problems they were intended to solveUnderstand the standard support for threading and concurrency and know how to put them on work for daily basic tasksLeverage C++’s features to get increased robustness and performanceExplore the widely-used testing frameworks for C++ and implement various useful patterns and idiomsWork with various types of strings and look at the various aspects of compilationExplore functions and callable objects with a focus on modern featuresLeverage the standard library and work with containers, algorithms, and iteratorsUse regular expressions for find and replace string operationsTake advantage of the new filesystem library to work with files and directoriesUse the new utility additions to the standard library to solve common problems developers encounter including string_view, any , optional and variant typesIn DetailC++ is one of the most widely used programming languages. Fast, efficient, and flexible, it is used to solve many problems. The latest versions of C++ have seen programmers change the way they code, giving up on the old-fashioned C-style programming and adopting modern C++ instead.Beginning with the modern language features, each recipe addresses a specific problem, with a discussion that explains the solution and offers insight into how it works. You will learn major concepts about the core programming language as well as common tasks faced while building a wide variety of software. You will learn about concepts such as concurrency, performance, meta-programming, lambda expressions, regular expressions, testing, and many more in the form of recipes. These recipes will ensure you can make your applications robust and fast.By the end of the book, you will understand the newer aspects of C++11/14/17 and will be able to overcome tasks that are time-consuming or would break your stride while developing.Style and approachThis book follows a recipe-based approach, with examples that will empower you to implement the core programming language features and explore the newer aspects of C++.Downloading the example code for this book.
