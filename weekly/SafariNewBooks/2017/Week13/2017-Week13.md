We explore how steering agile architecture can look like in practice by learning from concrete case studies. Even though each case study exhibits a distinct problem, all of them can be dealt with in a uniform way.In the following segments, we take a look at case studies to learn how understanding the situation informs the design process and leads to actions. Each case study exhibits a distinct problem, yet all of these case studies could be handled with the same tools and approach.

<div class="safaribook"><h2><a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/steering-agile-architecture/9781491987933/">Steering Agile Architecture Fundamentals</a></h2><p><img src="http://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/cover/9781491987933/" alt="Steering Agile Architecture Fundamentals"><ul><li>Authors: <strong>Tudor Gîrba</strong></li><li>Topic: <strong>Enterprise Architecture</strong></li><li>ISBN: <strong>9781491987933</strong></li><li>Publisher: <strong>O'Reilly Media, Inc.</strong></li></ul>
How can we steer architecture toward a cohesive result in projects developed with agility? How do we judge the nature of this problem? These are some of the fundamental questions we answer in this introduction to a concrete approach of steering agile architecture. We build an argument and introduce the notion of software assessment as an essential discipline for decision making and steering agile architecture.The goal of this video is to change the way software architects and developers perceive software architecture, especially in the context of a project developed with agility.We start from the fundamentals and define our view of software architecture as a means of supporting decision making. We then go through several case studies to show how steering architecture can look in practice. We describe the daily approach to growing architecture by involving the entire team, and we distill the skills needed to make this happen. We further expand the lessons to deal with other facets of agile architecture and introduce the humane assessment method. Finally, we go deeper into the means of exposing architectural problems, and we pay particular attention to the nature of tools that should be involved in every software development project.

Over the last decade, a new breed of
interactive systems has been introduced in consumer, research and
industry sectors. Predominantly driven by the mass gaming console
market and mobile 3D applications, 3D user interfaces (3D UIs) have
found wide acceptance. Technologies making use of 3D UIs include
console gaming systems, virtual reality (VR), augmented reality
(AR), robot teleoperation, and mobile/wearable computers. Such
systems generally are not limited to 2D interaction on a 2D
display; rather, they utilize three-dimensional (3D) output and/or
input, allowing the user to perceive and act much as she does in
the physical world. From the authors who wrote 3D User
Interfaces: Theory and Practice, the first comprehensive
exploration into 3D UIs, comes the second edition of this well
received text. This edition significantly expands upon the original
material to capture and structure 3D UI knowledge and to provide
guidelines to help current and future developers of 3D systems.This book features:
·         Basic human
factors and human computer interaction
·         Input and
output devices for 3D user interfaces
·         Techniques
for selection and manipulation, navigation, and system control
·         Design
strategies for creating 3D UIs and evaluating their
effectiveness
·         Focus on
virtual and augmented reality, gaming, human robot interaction, and
mobile applications
·         Case studies

This current and comprehensive book provides an updated treatment of molecular gas dynamics topics for aerospace engineers, or anyone researching high-temperature gas flows for hypersonic vehicles and propulsion systems. It demonstrates how the areas of quantum mechanics, kinetic theory, and statistical mechanics can combine in order to facilitate the study of nonequilibrium processes of internal energy relaxation and chemistry. All of these theoretical ideas are used to explain the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method, a numerical technique based on molecular simulation. Because this text provides comprehensive coverage of the physical models available for use in the DSMC method, in addition to the equations and algorithms required to implement the DSMC numerical method, readers will learn to solve nonequilibrium flow problems and perform computer simulations, and obtain a more complete understanding of various physical modeling options for DSMC than is available in other texts.

Recent advances suggest that the concept of information might hold the key to unravelling the mystery of life's nature and origin. Fresh insights from a broad and authoritative range of articulate and respected experts focus on the transition from matter to life, and hence reconcile the deep conceptual schism between the way we describe physical and biological systems. A unique cross-disciplinary perspective, drawing on expertise from philosophy, biology, chemistry, physics, and cognitive and social sciences, provides a new way to look at the deepest questions of our existence. This book addresses the role of information in life, and how it can make a difference to what we know about the world. Students, researchers, and all those interested in what life is and how it began will gain insights into the nature of life and its origins that touch on nearly every domain of science.

One viable option for organizations looking to harness massive amounts of data is the data lake, a single repository for storing all the raw data, both structured and unstructured, that floods into the company. But that isn’t the end of the story. The key to making a data lake work is data governance, using metadata to provide valuable context through tagging and cataloging.This practical report examines why metadata is essential for managing, migrating, accessing, and deploying any big data solution. Authors Federico Castanedo and Scott Gidley dive into the specifics of analyzing metadata for keeping track of your data—where it comes from, where it’s located, and how it’s being used—so you can provide safeguards and reduce risk. In the process, you’ll learn about methods for automating metadata capture.This report also explains the main features of a data lake architecture, and discusses the pros and cons of several data lake management solutions that support metadata. These solutions include:Traditional data integration/management vendors such as the IBM Research Accelerated Discovery LabTooling from open source projects, including Teradata Kylo and InformaticaStartups such as Trifacta and Zaloni that provide best of breed technology
