You've just boarded a plane. You've loaded your phone with your favorite podcasts, but before you can pop in your earbuds, disaster strikes: The guy in the next seat starts telling you all about something crazy that happened to him--in great detail. This is the unwelcome storyteller, trying to convince a reluctant audience to care about his story. We all hate that guy, right? But when you tell a story (any kind of story: a novel, a memoir, a screenplay, a stage play, a comic, or even a cover letter), you become the unwelcome storyteller. So how can you write a story that audiences will embrace? The answer is simple: Remember what it feels like to be that jaded audience. Tell the story that would win you over, even if you didn't want to hear it.The Secrets of Story provides comprehensive, audience-focused strategies for becoming a master storyteller. Armed with the Ultimate Story Checklist, you can improve every aspect of your fiction writing with incisive questions like these:  Concept: Is the one-sentence description of your story uniquely appealing?Character: Can your audience identify with your hero?Structure and Plot: Is your story ruled by human nature?Scene Work: Does each scene advance the plot and reveal character through emotional reactions?Dialogue: Is your characters' dialogue infused with distinct personality traits and speech patterns based on their lives and backgrounds?Tone: Are you subtly setting, resetting, and upsetting expectations?Theme: Are you using multiple ironies throughout the story to create meaning?To succeed in the world of fiction and film, you have to work on every aspect of your craft and satisfy your audience. Do both--and so much more--with The Secrets of Story. "Matt Bird is a certifiable writing-craft genius." --Cheryl Klein, Senior Editor at Arthur A. Levine Books "What makes this book valuable is how practical Bird is with his advice--every chapter is full of craft tricks and little insights that help take a moment from 'good enough' to 'great!' Consider his 'one-touch rule,' which can instantly add focus and shape to even the smallest scene. This book is full of real tools for real storytellers." --Jonathan Auxier, author of The Night Gardener "The Ultimate Story Checklist is the clearest road map I've seen for helping writers get to what makes a compelling story. I've been sharing Matthew's guide with writers for years." --Andrew Harwell, author of The Spider Ring "Matt Bird has cracked the code on how satisfying stories work. His insights will sharpen your plots, freshen your characters, and liberate your imagination. I always come away from reading Matt Bird feeling inspired and invigorated." --James Kennedy, author of The Order of Odd Fish "Bird's advice raises the bar and encourages 'writing greatness.' It's rare to find such clear and insightful tips about working at the most advanced end of the craft." --Elizabeth Fama, author of Monstrous Beauty "After I followed Matt Bird's writing advice, I received an offer of representation from an agent who called my manuscript 'masterfully structured.' It's a testament to how helpful Bird's advice has been--I've learned more from him than from any other book about writing, and certainly more than from taking any writing class." --Parker Peevyhouse, author of Where Futures End "Matt Bird's blog is possibly my favorite resource on storytelling, maybe even more than Robert McKee's Story. It's really insightful on story structure--detailed without being too rigid, and with a keen appreciation for both big blockbusters and smaller stories." --Emily Horner, author of A Love Story Starring My Dead Best Friend

The creation of public and government policy presents a &#8220;wicked&#8221; problem because it tends to be highly contested, involves many different stakeholders, and yields outcomes that change and evolve over time.

Developing Government Policy Capability examines the role project management plays in supporting how policy work is conducted. Using Australia&#8217;s controversial Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill 2011 as a case study, the authors explore the question: Can project management practices contribute to improving government policy development and implementation capability? Their argument&#8212;that project management can solve even &#8220;wicked&#8221; problems&#8212;is not necessarily new. As they explain, that&#8217;s pretty much what project management is all about.

Project managers need to clearly articulate, acknowledge, and legitimize invisible work&#8212;the bridge between what is being done and what is supposed to be done. The project management tool set and the importance of recognizing the societal dimension when planning and conducting projects can make it possible for practitioners to tackle even the most complex policy work.

An insider’s look at the SEC and the changes needed to strengthen the U.S. financial systemIn 2008, Americans were reeling from the devastating financial crisis that caused the Great Recession. There were searing questions about how the crisis was allowed to happen and calls for immediate reform from Capital Hill, the news media, and the general public. Multiple scandals sent real fear through the investing community and brought unprecedented heat on the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). There was little doubt that the SEC had to fix rules that permitted bad behavior, shake off decades of complacency and enforce existing laws.Wall Street lawyer Norm Champ spent nearly 20 years dealing with the SEC on behalf of his clients and as an industry representative working to educate the agency about hedge funds. Believing he could help reform the deeply-flawed agency, Champ left his career in the private sector and joined the SEC. As Director of the Division of Investment Management, he became a key player in stabilizing trillions of dollars of investor capital while reenergizing the SEC’s culture and management.In Going Public, Champ presents a rare, insider’s look at how the SEC operates and explains exactly how the agency impacts the overall economic health of the country. He examines the inner workings of hedge funds, economic policy and politics, investing, and inefficient and frustrating federal agencies. Engrossing and important, this book offers critical recommendations for policy changes that will create healthy, free-functioning markets and help Americans better prepare for the inevitable next crisis.

An Evidence-Based Approach to Personality and LeadershipA leader’s bullying and constant dismissal of his team’s concerns nearly take down an entire company—and the global financial system. The U.S. Government has to provide a $182 billion bailout. A new CEO transforms a near-bankrupt auto company and its infamously competitive culture becomes more collaborative and thrives—making it the only auto manufacturer to not take bailout funds.These stories share a truth: Each leader’s personality set the course of their company’s future. We all know that IQ, education, knowledge, and technical skills are essential for professionals, but they alone are insufficient for effective leadership. Who you are as a person—your personality and character—drives leadership performance and determines who thrives and who fails.In Personality at Work, psychologist Ron Warren lays out the key personality traits that drive high performance—and the common traits that derail it. Warren clusters closely related traits into four dimensions of behavior:

• Teamwork/Social Intelligence
• Deference
• Dominance
• Grit/Task Mastery.Each cluster is broken down into personality traits—13 in all.Personality at Work draws from research using the renowned LMAP 360 with 20,000 leaders and 250,000 360-feedback raters. An assessment used at organizations around the world, LMAP 360 is used at Harvard Business School, Yale School of Management, Underwriter Laboratories, BearingPoint, Deloitte, Teach for America, Clayton Homes, and more than 35 hospital systems throughout the United States.Personality at Work integrates research on personality and performance, teamwork, communications, judgment, and decision-making. You will learn how to …• Recognize your own personality patterns and those of colleagues
• Understand the links between personality, leadership, and organizational effectiveness
• Turn insights into action, leading with Grit and EQ to drive individual and team performance

A Generalized Framework of Linear Multivariable Control proposes a number of generalized models by using the generalized inverse of matrix, while the usual linear multivariable control theory relies on some regular models. The book supports that in H-infinity control, the linear fractional transformation formulation is relying on the inverse of the block matrix. If the block matrix is not regular, the H-infinity control does not apply any more in the normal framework. Therefore, it is very important to relax those restrictions to generalize the classical notions and models to include some non-regular cases.This book is ideal for scholars, academics, professional engineer and students who are interested in control system theory.Presents a comprehensive set of numerical procedures, algorithms, and examples on how to deal with irregular modelsProvides a summary on generalized framework of linear multivariable control that focuses on generalizations of models and notionsIntroduces a number of generalized models by using the generalized inverse of matrix

John Naisbitt, in his book, Global Paradox, says "the bigger the world economy, the more powerful its smaller players." Big international companies are deconstructing themselves and creating new structures to survive in the new world order. Concepts like reengineering, rightsizing, network organizations and the virtual corporation are fast becoming the common theme in business practice. International strategic alliances are also on the increase based on the notion that no single company and no single country can alone be a successful player in the new global game. The organizational applications and managerial implications of these technology resources warrant a forum for the discussion of these issues. The Journal of Global Information Management (JGIM) has an important role to play in providing such a forum for researchers and practitioners to share leading-edge knowledge in the global information resource management area.This issue contains the following articles:Mobile Value Added Services in Fiji: Institutional Drivers, Industry Challenges, and Adoption by Women Micro EntrepreneursCritical Success Factors to Establish 5G Network in Smart Cities: Inputs for Security and PrivacyReview of Discussions on Internet of Things (IoT): Insights from Twitter AnalyticsModeling Gender based Customer Preferences of Information Search ChannelsChange Management in Information AssetAn Optimization Model for Mapping Organization and Consumer Preferences for Internet Information Channels

Today, digitization is dramatically changing the business landscape, and many progressive organizations have started to treat data as a valuable business asset.  While many enterprises are investing in improved data management, only a few have leveraged data to truly impact business performance. To address this problem, 
Data for Business Performance provides readers with practical guidance and proven techniques to derive value from data in today's business environment. Specifically, 
this book:  
is holistic, as it looks at deriving value for all three key purposes of data: decision making, compliance, and customer service.
is for practitioners, with practical guidance and proven techniques  supported by real world examples.
is relevant for the current business and IT landscape.
is novel, with the adoption of the Goal-Question-Metric (GQM) framework as the core mechanism to monetize data in the organization, based on business goals, key questions, and key performance indicators (KPIs).
is technology-agnostic, as concepts are used for unlocking the value of data without any reference to proprietary technologies. 

This book is absolutely timely and relevant in today's data-driven world.  Most of the books on data available in the market today focus on data quality, governance, and analytics. This book from Dr. Prashanth Southekal is brilliant as it puts the business stakeholder at the center by addressing the key value propositions of the business user. This book is holistic and I strongly believe it will help to bridge the gaps we have today.

Prashanth has given a very practical guide to implement data culture in an organization. The book Data for Business Performance talks about building the organization of the future and the role of data. Prashanth rightly believes and demonstrates that data is not an asset of the IT team and is an organization-wide asset. He proposes the need for the chief data officer (CDO) as a role that should anchor data and report to the CEO, and manage the stakeholders' data needs.  

Harshajith Umapathy
 Senior Vice President, Hansa Cequity, India

Dr. Southekal provides valuable insights on data and information management in mostly short and clearly written sections. Anyone interested in the data-driven company should read this book and learn about the hurdles on the road to be data-driven, and his valuable suggestions on how to overcome them. His wisdom may prevent some of the failures that helped him learn.
