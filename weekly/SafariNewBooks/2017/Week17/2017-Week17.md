When faced with a human error problem, you may be tempted to ask 'Why didn't they watch out better? How could they not have noticed?'. You think you can solve your human error problem by telling people to be more careful, by reprimanding the miscreants, by issuing a new rule or procedure. These are all expressions of 'The Bad Apple Theory', where you believe your system is basically safe if it were not for those few unreliable people in it. This old view of human error is increasingly outdated and will lead you nowhere.  The new view, in contrast, understands that a human error problem is actually an organizational problem. Finding a 'human error' by any other name, or by any other human, is only the beginning of your journey, not a convenient conclusion. The new view recognizes that systems are inherent trade-offs between safety and other pressures (for example: production). People need to create safety through practice, at all levels of an organization.   Breaking new ground beyond its successful predecessor, The Field Guide to Understanding Human Error guides you through the traps and misconceptions of the old view. It explains how to avoid the hindsight bias, to zoom out from the people closest in time and place to the mishap, and resist the temptation of counterfactual reasoning and judgmental language. But it also helps you look forward. It suggests how to apply the new view in building your safety department, handling questions about accountability, and constructing meaningful countermeasures. It even helps you in getting your organization to adopt the new view and improve its learning from failure.  So if you are faced by a human error problem, abandon the fallacy of a quick fix.

Adam Kahane has faced this challenge many times, working on big issues like democracy and jobs and climate change and on everyday issues in organizations and families. He has learned that our conventional understanding of collaboration—that it requires a harmonious team that agrees on where it's going, how it's going to get there, and who needs to do what—is wrong. Instead, we need a new approach to collaboration that embraces discord, experimentation, and genuine cocreation—which is exactly what Kahane provides in this groundbreaking and timely book.

Staff-Less Libraries: Innovative Staff Design considers the challenges of this approach, its pros and cons, identifies international experiences, and discusses best practices. It presents a step-by-step approach to implementing a staffless library and/or services, and seeks to inspire professionals to share experiences and optimize their library. Staff-less public libraries, enabled by technological developments, represent a significant and innovative aspect of the development of public libraries. The concept radically enlarges the availability of user access to public libraries. Some Danish public library branches have, for example, increased their weekly opening hours from 20 to 80 hours per week. In Denmark, the concept has been quite successful, increasing the number of staff-less libraries from 81 public library units in 2011 to 260 in 2014. From a longer view, however, the staff-less library concept contributes to the modernization of public libraries by further opening the library. Many library professionals have been surprised by the near absence of vandalism through the staffl-ess opening hours. According to the latest trend, the staffless library model is gradually moving from thinly populated rural areas and suburban neighborhoods to urban contexts. This book explores the concept, hence furthering the debate.Presents and considers the idea of staff-less libraries using evidence-based dataConsiders the challenges, pros, and cons of the staff-less libraryIdentifies international experiences, best practices, and draws out a step-by-step approach to implementation

Collective Action 2.0 explores the issues related to information and communication technologies (ICTs) in detail, providing a balanced insight into how ICTs leverage and interact with collective action, which will have an impact on the current discourse. Recent events in different authoritarian regimes, such as Iran and Egypt, have drawn global attention to a developing phenomenon in collective action: People tend to organize through different social media platforms for political protest and resistance. This phenomenon describes a change in social structure and behavior tied to ICT. Social media platforms have been used to leverage collective action, which has in some cases arguably lead, to political revolution. The phenomenon also indicates that the way information is organized affects the organization of social structures with which it interoperates. The phenomenon also has another side, which is the use of social media for activist suppression, state and corporate surveillance, commodifi cation of social processes, demobilization, or for the mobilization of collective action toward undesirable ends.• Analyzes social media and collective action in an in-depth and balanced manner• Presents an account of avoiding technological determinism, utopianism, and fundamentalism• Considers the underlying theory behind quick-paced social media• Takes an interdisciplinary approach that will resonate with all those interested in social media andcollective action, regardless of fi eld specialism

The Accessible Guide to Modern Wireless
Communication for Undergraduates, Graduates, and Practicing
Electrical EngineersWireless communication is a critical
discipline of electrical engineering and computer science, yet the
concepts have remained elusive for students who are not specialists
in the area. This text makes digital communication and receiver
algorithms for wireless communication broadly accessible to
undergraduates, graduates, and practicing electrical engineers.
Notably, the book builds on a signal processing foundation and does
not require prior courses on analog or digital communication.Introduction to Wireless Digital
Communication establishes the principles of communication,
from a digital signal processing perspective, including key
mathematical background, transmitter and receiver signal processing
algorithms, channel models, and generalizations to multiple
antennas. Robert Heath’s “less is more” approach
focuses on typical solutions to common problems in wireless
engineering.Heath presents digital communication
fundamentals from a signal processing perspective, focusing on the
complex pulse amplitude modulation approach used in most commercial
wireless systems. He describes specific receiver algorithms for
implementing wireless communication links, including
synchronization, carrier frequency offset estimation, channel
estimation, and equalization. While most concepts are presented for
systems with single transmit and receive antennas, Heath concludes
by extending those concepts to contemporary MIMO systems.To promote learning, each chapter includes
previews, bullet-point summaries, examples, and numerous homework
problems to help readers test their knowledge.Basics of wireless communication: applications, history, and
the central role of signal processingDigital communication essentials: components, channels,
distortion, coding/decoding, encryption, and
modulation/demodulationSignal processing: linear time invariant systems,
probability/random processes, Fourier transforms, derivation of
complex baseband signal representation and equivalent channels, and
multi-rate signal processingLeast-squared estimation techniques that build on the linear
algebra typically taught to electrical engineering
undergraduatesComplex pulse amplitude modulation: symbol mapping,

The energy industry's accelerated evolution requires visionary changeThe Final Frontier parses the evolution of the oil and gas sector to map out a plan for going forward. The global energy industry is huge, and it is in disarray; between low oil and gas prices, climate change, rising development costs, and ever-mounting regulations, the need for change has been made crystal clear—but planning is much easier than implementation, and stasis is not progress. This book shows how redesigning internal operating models can bring about the necessary change in the implementation of upstream capabilities-driven strategies. From integrated, national, major, and independent oil companies, to the service companies in the upstream supply chain, there isn't an enterprise in the sector that cannot benefit from reduced costs and increased efficiency. Knowing that change is necessary is not enough—this book shows you what to change, and how to change it to get off the treadmill and start moving forward. With expert guidance through each redesign element, this insightful guide provides more than simply ideas: it provides real, practical guidance on transforming operations to keep pace with the changes and create lasting advantage. Identify the most relevant organizational capabilities for your resource portfolio, as well as the changes that can translate into savings and efficiencyBuild a workable plan for real-world implementationRedesign the operating model most suited to the needs of your business on an organization-wide basisLearn what to do differently and how to do it differentlyThe energy industry has made great strides: our understanding of the global resource base, the nature of ownership and principal stakeholders, new technologies for resource development, and our economics and business models have all undergone a tremendous revolution, but now the more difficult—and more valuable—task begins.

The latest, definitive assessment of the state of free press around the worldAttacks on the Press is a comprehensive, annual account of press conditions worldwide, focusing this year on the new face of censorship perpetrated by governments and non-state actors. Compiled by the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), the 2017 edition documents new dangers and threats to journalists and to the free and independent media. The risks are a combination of familiar censorship tactics applied in novel ways, and the exertion of pressure through unconventional means or at unprecedented levels. These censorship efforts range from withholding advertising to online trolling, website blocking to physical harassment, imprisonment to the murder of journalists. In the Americas, governments and non-state actors use new, sometimes subtle ways to limit journalists' ability to investigate wrongdoing. In Europe, authorities deploy intelligence services to intimidate the press in the name of national security. In Asia, governments block access to information online, and in some cases, punish those who manage to get around the obstacles. And throughout the world, terror groups are using the threat of targeted murder to compel journalists to refrain from covering crucial stories or otherwise self-censor. Attacks on the Press documents how these new forms of censorship are perpetrated and provides journalists with guidance on how to work around them, when possible, and how to ensure their own safety as well as the safety of their sources and people with whom they work. The book enables readers to: Examine the state of free media around the worldLearn which nations violate press freedom with impunityDiscover the most dangerous beats and regionsDelve inside specific, increasingly complex challengesCPJ's mission is to defend the rights of journalists to report the news without fear of reprisal. Attacks on the Press provides a platform for direct advocacy with governments and the diplomatic community, for giving voice to journalists globally, and for ensuring that those journalists have a seat in discussions at the United Nations, the Organization of American States, the European Union, the African Union, and others.

Is your team considering agile? Are you interested in agile software development, and want to learn more? Do you think agile might help you build better software? You’re not alone. Agile is increasingly popular with software teams because the ones that have “gone agile” often talk about the great results they get. The software they build is better, which makes a big difference to them and their users. Not only that, but when agile teams are effective, they have a much better time at work! Things are more relaxed, and the working environment is a lot more enjoyable.Head First Agile is a brain-friendly guide to understanding agile concepts and ideas. Here’s what you’ll find inside:The agile mindset, what an agile methodology is, and why agile methodologies that seem so different can still all be agileScrum, and how it can help you build better, more valuable software, and make your team and your users happierXP, and how its focus on code and programming can help you and your team build better systemsLean and Kanban, and how they can help your whole team get better every dayWe have two goals for Head First Agile. First and foremost, we want you to learn agile: what it is, and how it can help you build better software and improve your team. But we also are focused on our readers looking to pass the PMI-ACP certification, so not only does the book have 100% coverage of the material for the PMI-ACP exam, it also includes end-of-chapter exam questions, a complete exam study guide, exam tips, and a full-length practice PMI-ACP exam—everything that you need to pass the exam.So while Head First Agile is useful for developers, project managers, and others who want to prepare for and pass the PMI-ACP certification exam, this unique book is also valuable for software team members (including developers) who don't necessarily need to pass the PMI-ACP certification exam, but want to learn about agile and how it can help them.Based on the latest research in cognitive science and learning theory, this book uses a visually rich format to engage your mind, rather than a text-heavy approach that puts you to sleep.

Hold on, because we’re entering the age of smart transportation at astonishing speed. By 2020, roughly one in every five vehicles (250 million) will be on the road. Within the next 10 years, the very idea of manually operating a car, truck, ship, plane, or train may seem old fashioned, as the overarching trend will be toward greater automation at every level of transportation. Are we ready for it?In this report, Mike Barlow examines the autonomous vehicle ecosystem through interviews with several technology firms, including Cloudera, that are busy working on various aspects of connected transportation. Vehicles in motion—on land, in the air, or on the sea—will generate and transmit huge quantities of data to transportation infrastructure (roads, bridges, traffic signals), and other vehicles. The data from your car, in fact, may soon be more valuable than the car itself.Get a copy of this report and learn how the vehicles of tomorrow (or maybe the day after tomorrow) will impact mobility management, safety, vehicle management, operator well-being, entertainment, and even the way cities are designed.

There is currently no single book that covers the mathematics, circuits, and electromagnetics backgrounds needed for the study of electromagnetic compatibility (EMC). This book aims to redress the balance by focusing on EMC and providing the background in all three disciplines. This background is necessary for many EMC practitioners who have been out of study for some time and who are attempting to follow and confidently utilize more advanced EMC texts.The book is split into three parts: Part 1 is the refresher course in the underlying mathematics; Part 2 is the foundational chapters in electrical circuit theory; Part 3 is the heart of the book: electric and magnetic fields, waves, transmission lines and antennas. Each part of the book provides an independent area of study, yet each is the logical step to the next area, providing a comprehensive course through each topic. Practical EMC applications at the end of each chapter illustrate the applicability of the chapter topics. The Appendix reviews the fundamentals of EMC testing and measurements.

A new, more comprehensive approach to long-term family wealth managementMore Than Money provides a high-level, integrated approach to preserving both financial resources and family harmony. Research has shown a failure rate of 70 percent in long-term multigenerational wealth management, and contrary to popular assumption, only five percent of that failure is due to bad investment, poor tax planning, or inadequate performance by legal and financial advisors. The number-one reason family wealth management fails is the family itself; poor communication, lack of trust, divergent visions, and a failure to prepare succeeding generations will tear down the resources the family has worked so hard to build. Traditional wealth management cannot fix this. Instead, this book offers a fresh approach that integrates strategic and tactical wealth management to align the family’s assets with the family members.  With helpful tools and advice drawn from a real-world understanding of family complexities, you’ll improve your ability to preserve your family’s resources over multiple generations.With an expert’s perspective on the real forces behind successful family wealth management, this book provides a clear model and a practical roadmap for long-term financial preservation.Develop a shared family vision and missionImprove communication and trust among membersMerge strategic and tactical planningEnsure the longevity of your family’s wealthThe wealth management sphere tends to focus on taxes, investments, banking, and estate planning, but little thought is given to the people themselves—this overlooks the fact that individual family members are the most critical factor in multigenerational wealth management, and fails to provide solutions. More Than Money merges traditional strategies with family dynamics, communication, governance, and preparation to help your resources last for generations to come.

Build a stress-free workflow to import, tag, rate, and organize your digital photos!Updated April 4, 2017Digital photography expert Jeff Carlson helps you understand the strengths and weaknesses of the three most popular photo-management applications: Photos from Apple, and Lightroom and Photoshop Elements from Adobe.Once you've picked the app that's right for you (there's a chapter on migrating to Lightroom from iPhoto, Aperture, or Photos), you'll learn to create a streamlined workflow for importing, evaluating, keywording, and tagging your photos so they are sorted into logical groups and are easy to find. For each of these essential aspects of your workflow, Jeff provides step-by-step instructions for each of the three covered apps. You'll also learn how to easily locate and remove duplicates.Think you don't have time for all of that? Learn to use the artificial intelligence in Apple's Photos and in Google Photos to do the heavy lifting of identifying faces, objects, and more in your photo collection.You'll also find advice on how mobile/cloud solutions fit into the mix, with notes on Google Photos, iCloud Photo Library, Lightroom mobile, Amazon Prime Photos, and Mylio.It's all too easy to lose everything if you don't have backups, so Jeff also discusses how to back up and archive photos to protect your irreplaceable photographic memories.You'll find expert advice about each of these photo-management topics:Shooting smarter: Make sure your camera is set to the correct time (and time zone), choose a file format, and think about capturing geolocation data while you're taking photos.Choosing the right app: Read about the pros and cons of the most popular photo-management applications -- Photos, Lightroom, and Photoshop Elements -- and find directions for migrating to Lightroom from iPhoto, Aperture, or Photos. There's also a sidebar about how to continue to use iPhoto or Aperture star ratings in Photos.Using artificial intelligence: Learn to harness artificial intelligence to have a computer do the work of identifying objects and faces in your photos. Jeff focuses on Apple's Photos app, which has quite a few helpful features, but also provides notes on Google Photos and Amazon Prime Photos.Importing photos: Make your Mac applies keywords and other tags in a batch during import, and make sure you're storing files in a place that makes sense going forward.Judging photos: Get time-tested tips for rating individual photos and learn how to deal with bad photos, whether you want to delete them, hide them, or leave them be.Assigning metadata: Once your camera and your computer have assigned as much metadata as possible automatically, you'll need to do the final bits yourself. Jeff describes how to think about this process and gives you specific steps for how to proceed efficiently.Putting photos in albums: With your metadata successfully applied, it's time to enjoy the fruits of your labor! Learn to set up smart albums to collect and display your photos automatically.Adding a mobile component: When it's time to apply metadata or cull bad photos, why sit at a desktop Mac when you can lounge in a recliner -- or work from your smartphone while waiting for the bus? Jeff helps you pick an online photo service that can put your photos on all your devices for viewing and editing. He provides a list of features to look for and provides notes on Amazon Prime Photos, Google Photos, iCloud Photo Library, Lightroom mobile, and Mylio.Planning for the future: Digital photos can't be damaged by water or tossed accidentally when cleaning house, but at the same time, a disk failure could destroy every photo you own. Jeff discusses how you can back up your precious photos and archive them for future generations.

Design great databases—from logical data modeling through physical schema definition. You will learn a framework that finally cracks the problem of merging data and process models into a meaningful and unified design that accounts for how data is actually used in production systems.Key to the framework is a method for taking the logical data model that is a static look at the definition of the data, and merging that static look with the process models describing how the data will be used in actual practice once a given system is implemented. The approach solves the disconnect between the static definition of data in the logical data model and the dynamic flow of the data in the logical process models.The design framework in this book can be used to create operational databases for transaction processing systems, or for data warehouses in support of decision support systems. The information manager can be a flat file, Oracle Database, IMS, NoSQL, Cassandra, Hadoop, or any other DBMS.Usage-Driven Database Design emphasizes practical aspects of design, and speaks to what works, what doesn't work, and what to avoid at all costs. Included in the book are lessons learned by the author over his 30+ years in the corporate trenches. Everything in the book is grounded on good theory, yet demonstrates a professional and pragmatic approach to design that can come only from decades of experience.Presents an end-to-end framework from logical data modeling through physical schema definition.Includes lessons learned, techniques, and tricks that can turn a database disaster into a success.Applies to all types of database management systems, including NoSQL such as Cassandra and Hadoop, and mainstream SQL databases such as Oracle and SQL ServerWhat You'll LearnCreate logical data models that accurately reflect the real world of the userCreate usage scenarios reflecting how applications will use a new databaseMerge static data models with dynamic process models to create resilient yet flexible database designsSupport application requirements by creating responsive database schemas in any database architectureCope with big data and unstructured data for transaction processing and decision support systemsRecognize when relational approaches won't work, and when to turn toward NoSQL solutions such as Cassandra or HadoopWho This Book Is ForSystem developers, including business analysts, database designers, database administrators, and application designers and developers who must design or interact with database systems

A practical, real-world training manual for mid-level managementManaging to Make a Difference  presents a leadership guide for those in the middle. The C-suite has a wealth of resources for leadership guidance, but middle managers face a quandary: often given little guidance on how to excel, they are also under enormous pressure to do a variety of things other than "lead." This book provides much-needed tools and techniques for building a high-performing team—without letting your other duties suffer. Organized around a coherent philosophy and based on solid research, the discussion offers a roadmap to engagement, talent development, and excellence in management. From difficult situations and organizational challenges to everyday motivation and inspiration, these techniques help middle managers achieve the goals of their organization while empowering their workers to achieve their own. Talent development is probably not your full-time job—yet it drives the engagement that results in high performance. This book shows you how to hit the "sweet spot" of middle management, with a host of tools and strategies to help you help your team shine. Motivate, inspire, and lead your team with confidenceManage through challenges and overcome obstaclesDevelop key talent and maintain high engagementAdopt practical management tools based on substantiated researchMost organizations direct the majority of their development resources to the C-suite, but still expect their mid-level managers to attract, engage, retain, and develop talent; but successfully juggling everyday duties while maintaining team performance and leading around roadblocks leaves little room for management planning. Managing to Make a Difference offers the solution in the form of tools, techniques, and practical strategy for a high performing team.

A no-holds-barred exposé on the financial transactions of the world's favourite sportThe transfer fees clubs pay to sign top players now top €4 billion a year but much of the money has been flowing out of the game. A small group of wealthy investors including Russian oligarchs, English racehorse owners and a former billionaire gold miner have seized the opportunity to enter this booming market.Some have moved in on the territory of banks and lent money to clubs in exchange for a share in fees generated by Cristiano Ronaldo, Neymar and dozens more of today's stars. Others have acquired obscure teams to get a piece of the pie.Even as the global financial crisis sent fortunes tumbling this select group found a profitable place to park their money. The size of the transfer market has continued to rise –- it increased seven-fold in value the last two decades, more than the FTSE share index.Between them, these wealthy investors have amassed hundreds of millions of euros in profits. At the same time, they have managed to stay out of the spotlight the world’s most popular sport brings.Football’s Secret Trade follows the money along a trail very few know about, from nondescript offices in the U.K. and ramshackle stadiums of South American clubs you have probably never heard of to offshore bank accounts in the Caribbean. Warning – you won’t see a major transfer deal in the same light again.

Write code that can adapt to changes.By applying this book’s principles,
you can create code that accommodates new requirements and
unforeseen scenarios without significant rewrites. Gary McLean Hall
describes Agile best practices, principles, and patterns for
designing and writing code that can evolve more quickly and easily,
with fewer errors, because it doesn’t impede change.Now revised, updated, and expanded, Adaptive
Code, Second Edition adds indispensable practical insights on
Kanban, dependency inversion, and creating reusable abstractions.
Drawing on over a decade of Agile consulting and development
experience, McLean Hall has updated his best-seller with deeper
coverage of unit testing, refactoring, pure dependency injection,
and more.Master powerful new ways to:• Write code that enables and
complements Scrum, Kanban, or any other Agile framework• Develop code that can survive major
changes in requirements• Plan for adaptability by using
dependencies, layering, interfaces, and design patterns• Perform unit testing and refactoring
in tandem, gaining more value from both• Use the “golden master”
technique to make legacy code adaptive• Build SOLID code with
single-responsibility, open/closed, and Liskov substitution
principles• Create smaller interfaces to support
more-diverse client and architectural needs• Leverage dependency injection best
practices to improve code adaptability• Apply dependency inversion with the
Stairway pattern, and avoid related anti-patternsAbout YouThis book is for programmers of all skill
levels seeking more-practical insight into design patterns, SOLID
principles, unit testing, refactoring, and related topics. Most
readers will have programmed in C#, Java, C++, or similar
object-oriented languages, and will be familiar with core
procedural programming techniques.
