In an ambient intelligence world, devices work in concert to support people in carrying out everyday life activities and tasks in a natural way using information and intelligence that is hidden in the network connecting these devices. Ambient intelligence emphasizes people and user experience and ensuring ultimately that the technology disappears into our surroundings until only the user interface remains visible to users. The International Journal of Ambient Computing and Intelligence (IJACI) will specifically focus on the convergence of ubiquitous computing, context, intelligent systems, networking and security. Ubiquitous computing will focus on mobility, location and the development of various ad hoc networking capabilities that exploit numerous low-cost computing devices. Intelligent systems research will focus on learning algorithms and pattern matchers, speech recognition, gesture classification and situation assessment. Context awareness will concentrate on the tracking and positioning of objects' and people's interactions with their environments. Finally, an appreciation of human-centric computer interfaces, intelligent agents, network security, indoor positioning and the social interactions of objects in environments is essential.This issue contains the following articles:Building Intelligent Transportation Cloud Data Center Based on SOAUser Experience in Social Human-Robot InteractionA Comparative Study of Statistical and Rough Computing Models in Predictive Data AnalysisA Decision Support System for Classification of Normal and Medical Renal Disease Using Ultrasound Images: A Decision Support System for Medical Renal DiseasesHow to Manage Persons Taken Malaise at the Steering Wheel Using HAaaS in a Vehicular Cloud Computing EnvironmentDisease Surveillance System for Big Climate Data Processing and Dengue Transmission

Harness the power of functional programming with advanced Haskell conceptsAbout This VideoDive into various important features such as IO, distributed programming, and Functional Reactive ProgrammingLearn the best practices in Haskell and alternative solutions to real-world situationsExplore powerful parallel algorithms, and build interactive applications using functional reactive programmingIn DetailHaskell is a lazy, purely-functional programming language with a very precise type system. Each of these features make Haskell quite different from mainstream object-oriented programming languages, which is where Haskell's appeal and its difficulty lie.In this course, you’ll discover different ways to structure interactions between the program and the outside world. We’ll look at some subtler aspects of the IO monad, such as lazy IO and unsafePerformIO. In addition to the IO monad, we’ll also check out two other structured forms of interaction: streaming libraries and functional reactive programming.Then we explore parallel, concurrent, and distributed programming. Thanks to purity, Haskell is especially well-suited for the first two, and so there are a number of approaches to cover. As for distributed programming, we focus on the idea of splitting a large monolithic program into smaller microservices, asking whether doing so is a good idea. We’ll also consider a different way of interacting with other microservices, and explore an alternative to microservices.By the end of this course, you’ll have an in-depth knowledge of various aspects of Haskell, allowing you to make the most of functional programming in Haskell.

Summary

Lesson Descriptions
Lesson 1: Setup
This lesson shows how to set up on the platform used throughout the course. It also demonstrates the final product--a Pie Factory that you interact with through a web browser. The backend demonstrates how to hold the logic and data that powers the factory.
Lesson 2: The Recipe Python Handling Text
This lesson focuses on how to read input from an external source. In this case, it's a copy of my Grandmother's Apple pie recipe saved to disk. We break the text up into parts. We introduce the concept of functions. Finally, we refactor all the breaking up of the recipe code into functions to introduce reusability.
Lesson 3: Ingredients Python Base Types (string, int, decimal, tuple, lists)
This lesson focuses on converting the text in the recipe into some representative data types so we can work with them. For example, our program needs to know what the string "1/2 cup of flour" really means.
Lesson 4: Mixing Ingredients Python Dictionaries
In Lesson 2, we read the ingredients/steps. In Lesson 3, we parsed those ingredients to gain some understanding of what they do. Now we take the steps and mix the ingredients so that you come to a deeper understanding of advanced data structures, like dictionaries.
Lesson 5 Bake It Python: Functions
This lesson goes deeper into functions in Python. You learn about the syntax, how to write, how to execute, and how to document. You learn a little bit about how to run many functions at the same time. Finally, you learn about parameters and arguments and how they can be customized in order to form more functionality to accomplish real tasks while re-using code.
Lesson 6: Many Types of Pie Python Classes
In this lesson, we start creating our own Pie Class. The running metaphor melds nicely with the idea of repeatability without giving up flexibility. We experience the beauty of Python as we start to dive deeper into the concepts of object-oriented programming.
Lesson 7: Pie Factory Object-Oriented Python
In this lesson, you learn how Python works as a glue language. You learn about Application Program Interfaces (APIs) and how and why to use them. Similar to Lesson 2, when we read data into our program, you now learn how we both read data in and push data out to other programs. This enables our program to talk to another program. Before we do so, we set a simulation so we can isolate functionally before we hook it all up in Lesson 8.
Lesson 8: Pie Store Visuals UX/UI Design
In this final lesson, we create our complete program and talk about the technology stack. We create a simple User Interface for the browser, and we hook that up to our code. We learn about a couple of open source libraries that provide some underlying functionality to support us in the task.

Agile is an iterative approach to software development that has rapidly gained popularity in the IT industry as the preferred alternative to traditional project management. For business analysts, adopting an Agile approach can revolutionize working practices. It enables clearer vision and success measure definitions, better stakeholder engagement and a greater understanding of customer needs, amongst other benefits. This book provides a comprehensive introduction to Agile methodologies and explains these in the context of business analysis. It is ideal for business analysts wanting to learn and understand Agile practices, working in an Agile environment, or undertaking Agile certifications. --

''This book is invaluable to anyone undertaking agile analysis, illustrating that by using new techniques to supplement and extend the BA toolkit, and adopting a &#8220;just enough, just in time&#8221; philosophy, a truly agile delivery approach can be supported.'' Dr Terri Lydiard, Teal Business Solutions Ltd   --- 
''The complex world of Agile made relevant for BAs. Combines well-explained theory with wide-ranging practical application and offers an essential handbook for anyone involved in the Agile project world. A valuable addition to the BA toolkit.'' Sandra Leek, Lloyds Banking Group, Senior Lead Business Analyst and IIBA Business Analyst of the Year 2014  ---  
''I have never understood those in the Agile community that have insisted that there is no need for an analyst role in the context of Agile projects. The project team needs access to first-hand business knowledge, combined with empowered and timely decision making but if the business representatives don&#8217;t have the experience or skills to translate their contribution to the project team, then the project will suffer. With this book, Lynda and Debra bridge this gap and help not only the business but also the Agile community, to understand why the gap exists, what can be done to address it, which existing roles can help, and how existing Agile roles and practices contribute to the solution. I highly recommend it.'' Julian Holmes, Thought Works, Principal Consultant

Background
Die Erlangung und Aufrechterhaltung der akkreditierten Zertifizierung nach der internationalen Norm f&#252;r Informationssicherheit-Management - ISO 27001 - kann ein kompliziertes Vorhaben darstellen, besonders dann, wenn die Norm f&#252;r Sie noch neu ist.

Autor Alan Calder kennt ISO 27001 in- und auswendig: der Gr&#252;nder und Vorstandsvorsitzende von IT Governance, er leitete die erste Implementierung eines nach BS 7799 zertifizierten Managementsystems - dem Vorl&#228;ufer der ISO 27001 - und arbeitet seither mit der Norm und seinen Nachfolgern zusammen.

Hunderte Organisationen weltweit haben akkreditierte Zertifizierungen nach ISO 27001 mit der IT-Governance-Beratung erlangt- wie in diesem Buch zusammengefasst.

Kaufen Sie dieses Buch heute und erlernen Sie die neun Schritte f&#252;r eine erfolgreiche ISO 27001 ISMS Implementierung.

Over 90 Minutes of Video InstructionOverview

Many Java developers today are working on applications written before the release of Java SE 8. Even after Java 8 is adopted for new features, it’s likely that these legacy applications will not take full advantage of Java 8 without significant refactoring.Description

Being data-driven is a hot phrase, but what does it mean in practice? As the tide of digitization rises, every industry sector is poised to be transformed: digital manufacture such as 3D printing has commoditized prototyping and product development; mobile apps have put every business in direct contact with their customers; and the Internet of Things promises the ability to manipulate processes and environment. The result of this digitization is an unprecedented flood of data.The ability to make decisions based on this data, and to use it to experiment rapidly, has become an imperative for today’s companies who wish to play a part in tomorrow’s market. An "experimental enterprise" is a company whose infrastructure is designed to make experimentation possible and efficient. It is not about finding analytical fairy dust that you can sprinkle to make everything better, but rather a deep-rooted approach to operations, innovation, and competition.Although digitization is unquestionably an issue for the entire company, it places a laser focus on the IT organization. In a digitized marketplace, IT must transform from being "faster paper" to one in which it underpins strategic advantage. This is not an incremental change, but a radical reassessment. Within IT, there are six critical building blocks that can be used to build an experimental enterprise: the cloud, devops, and open source; agile development and platforms; and data science. This video introduces each of these building blocks in turn, and explains how the audience can use them in their own organizations to adapt and thrive under challenging and rapidly changing market conditions.
