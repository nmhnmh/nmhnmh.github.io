 “It is not necessary to change. Survival is not mandatory.”¬†- W. Edwards Deming
 
 Work takes time to flow through an organization and ultimately be deployed to production where it captures value. It’s critical to reduce time-to-production. Software is a competitive advantage for many organizations and industries.
 
 Organizations break their larger software ambitions into smaller, independently deployable, feature-centric batches of work--microservices. In order to reduce the round-trip between stations of work, organizations collapse or consolidate as much of them as possible and automate the rest; developers and operations beget “devops”; and cloud-based services and platforms (like Cloud Foundry) automate operations work and break down the need for ITIL tickets and change management boards.
 
 But velocity, for velocity’s sake, is dangerous. Microservices invite architectural complexity that few are prepared to address.¬†
 In¬†Cloud Native Java LiveLessons, we look at how high-performance organizations are addressing the requirements of distribution with Spring Cloud.

Learning practitioners have, for too long, been struggling to shift the perception of learning and development from a function that is a cost to the organization, to that of a function that is central to delivering value-added activities for the organization. The ability to deliver a return on investment is not about investing in good evaluation mechanisms, although this is important. It is imperative that the learning practitioner owns the numbers and works with financial metrics in order to bid for adequate resources and support the organization&#8217;s strategic ambitions. This book offers a brief overview of both a theoretical and a practical framework. The theoretical underpinning provides an examination of how the theories and research about human and group dynamic processes and self-renewal can be utilized in intervention design. The emphasis is on the &#8220;self-renewal&#8221; ability of the individual and the facilitation of the movement of groups to improve the health and effectiveness of organizations in a sustainable way.

A contrarian challenge to the status quo, this book vigorously champi&#173;ons healthy skepticism in management theory and practice. Several com&#173;mon management maxims &#8212; often taken for granted as truisms &#8212; are examined and debunked with evidence-based arguments. The constant repetition of these flawed tropes perpetuates their mythological status and limits personal and organizational performance. Far from a business as usual business book, Deconstructing Manage&#173;ment Maxims has been researched with academic rigor yet written in an approachable style. Unafraid of taking on conventional business wisdom, it contains some controversial yet substantiated positions that will pro&#173;voke critical thinking and debate. After all, sacred cows and long-believed tenets of management lore do not go away quietly. A clear message from this book is that you don&#8217;t have to believe everything you read or hear&#8212;be it in the classroom or at work!

There are more similarities than differences between how artists and scientists work. Both ask countless questions. Both search in earnest for answers. Both are dedicated to reaching the best results. Not so different from today's trainers, are they?

 

Elaine Biech, one of the most highly regarded names in talent development, has set out to identify the perfect blend of content mastery and audience insight. The result is this highly informative book.The Art and Science of Training presents the science for learning and development, but it also emphasizes that training success lies in knowing what to do when things don't go as planned.

 

Discover how top facilitators always put learners first, even when faced with exceptions to the rule&#8212;the unwilling learner, the uninformed supervisor, the inappropriate delivery medium, or the unmanageable performance challenge. And learn why you must understand people, not only content, to ensure consistently exceptional learning experiences.

Emotional Self-Awareness is the capacity to tune into your own feelings, sense inner signals, and recognize how your feelings affect you and your performance. It is an important skill for leadership at any level, as well as many aspects of life.

The purpose of developing Emotional Self-Awareness is that it allows us to understand how our bodily sensations and our emotions impact ourselves, others, and our environment. Each moment is an opportunity to be self-aware. Thus, the more we practice it, the more proficient we become and the greater our capacity to recognize the space between stimuli and our response to that stimuli, ensuring a more conscious and skillful approach.

Without Emotional Self-Awareness, it is difficult to become proficient in and consistently use the other Emotional and Social Intelligence Competencies.

In Emotional Self-Awareness: A Primer, Daniel Goleman and his colleagues introduce Emotional Intelligence and the Emotional Self-Awareness Competency, laying the foundation for developing Emotional Intelligence in Leadership. This is the first in a series of Primers that explores each of the 12 Emotional and Social Intelligence Leadership Competencies, with a thorough overview of the Competency Model itself.

Daniel Goleman, Richard Boyatzis, Richard Davidson, Vanessa Druskat, and George Kohlrieser explain the Competencies: what they are, why they matter, and how to develop them.

Here&#8217;s some of what&#8217;s included:

What is Emotional Intelligence?
Emotional Intelligence Competencies
The Competency Model
Leadership effectiveness and Emotional Intelligence
The brain and body basis for Emotional Self-Awareness
How to know if you&#8217;re self-aware
Self-Awareness in action
The group equivalent of self-awareness
Whether you are individual looking to elevate your personal performance, a consultant or coach in need of research-based resources, or a head of leadership development in your organization seeking a brief yet informative resource to share with your team, this Primer is for you.

Total length is 62 pages, plus citations. Soft cover.

Risk management strategy for the pioneering technological sectorEnterprise Risk and Opportunity Management provides much-needed guidance tailored specifically to the technological sector. While most enterprise risk management guides are written for traditional businesses and finance firms, this book translates effective enterprise risk and opportunity management (EROM) principles into strategies and practices that work for government, nonprofit, and for-profit organizations in the technological space. Originally designed for noncommercial pioneering enterprises like NASA, an entire chapter is now devoted toward applying the methods to profit-making technological enterprises. A 40-year veteran of the tech sector, Dr. Allan Benjamin outlines risk management strategies for organizations in which the advancement and integration of science and technology within complex systems is necessary for accomplishment of the mission. Commercial EROM strategies do not translate directly when the development and implementation of risky technologies is the organization's primary objective, and clumsy or near-sighted implementation can easily cripple progress. This book provides authoritative guidance tailored to the sector's specialized needs. Maximize opportunity while effectively managing riskUnderstand the core principles of the technological EROM approach and its interfaces with the management of the organizationComprehend the intricacies of aggregating risks and opportunities from lower to higher levels of the organizationGain expert insights specific to the technology sectorMitigate and control the risk that comes with pursuing discoveryIn practice, EROM in this sector involves working with mostly qualitative data, and is characterized by high uncertainty. Managing risk without handicapping the organization requires a specific set of adjustments to traditional EROM, and a more nuanced approach to the idea of "acceptable risk. Balance is key in technological EROM, and Enterprise Risk and Opportunity Management provides foundational guidance, real-world strategy, and enlightening examples for getting it right.

The smarter way to build fast and dynamic android apps. About This VideoImplement TDD methodology to create smarter and more effective apps in less time.Create your own unit tests, acceptance test and Mocking objectsModularize your app development process to make it smoother, more resilient and faster.In DetailIn Test Driven Android Development, we discuss how good Object Oriented Design and Test Driven Design are complementary. We create a simple JUnit test, using a stub object that represents a data feed. Next, we demonstrate how to write a test driven design unit test for a Java class that performs network operations. After that, we create a unit test for a data access object that uses a JSON data feed. Our test includes JUnit 4 asserts and Hamcrest-style asserst. Then, we discuss blockers that prevent us from writing unit tests, and how we can use Mockito, code coverage, and automatic test execution to ameliorate those blockers. Finally, we look at UI testing with Espresso, and multi-platform testing with Firebase.

Evolutionary computation algorithms are employed to minimize functions with large number of variables. Biogeography-based optimization (BBO) is an optimization algorithm that is based on the science of biogeography, which researches the migration patterns of species. These migration paradigms provide the main logic behind BBO. Due to the cross-disciplinary nature of the optimization problems, there is a need to develop multiple approaches to tackle them and to study the theoretical reasoning behind their performance. This manuscript intends to explain the mathematical model of BBO algorithm and its variants created to cope with continuous domain problems (with and without constraints) and combinatorial problems.Due to the cross-disciplinary nature of the optimization problems, there is a need to develop multiple approaches to tackle them and to study the theoretical reasoning behind their performance.

Layout designers rejoice: CSS finally has an update that will make your lives easier. Flexible box layout, often called Flexbox, frees you from the challenges of creating layouts with floats and padding? and lets you specify containers and their contents instead. The new model means you can specify the directions in which material flows, how content wraps, and the ways components can expand to fill a space. Whether you've been creating large sites or small, fixed sites or responsive sites, flexbox will simplify your work.

The basic ideas of type inheritance—and the languages and products supporting those ideas—have been around for many years.  However, those languages and products are typically quite ad hoc, and they all exhibit surprising—not to say undesirable—behavior on occasion.  Why?  Because there has never been any consensus on a well-defined type inheritance model on which such languages and products might be built.  In this video seminar, internationally recognized relational database expert Chris Date describes a formal, abstract, rigorous, and robust alternative to this state of affairs by taking you through a detailed explanation of the inheritance model that he and his colleague Hugh Darwen first described in The Third Manifesto.   Designed for data and database professionals, the course examines single and multiple inheritance; scalar, tuple, and relation inheritance; type lattices and union and intersection types; polymorphism and substitutability; compile time and run time binding; and a detailed discussion and analysis of inheritance as supported in the SQL standard. Explore and understand the inheritance model proposed in The Third ManifestoUnderstand why the model is necessary, its components, and its unifying characteristicsExamine alternative inheritance schemes and the pertinent features of the SQL standardEnjoy a rare opportunity to learn from one of the model’s co-inventorsExamine the model in detailChris Date is an internationally known author, lecturer, researcher, and consultant, specializing in relational database technology. A Computing Industry Hall of Fame inductee, Chris is best known for his book An Introduction to Database Systems (8th edition, Addison-Wesley, 2004), which has sold more than 900,000 copies and is used in colleges and universities worldwide. In addition to the O’Reilly title Type Inheritance and Relational Theory: Subtypes, Supertypes, and Substitutability, Chris has authored more than twenty other O’Reilly titles including, SQL and Relational Theory, The New Relational Database Dictionary, and Relational Theory for Computer Professionals.

No photographer works in a vacuum. Photographers, like all artists, stand on the shoulders of those who came before them, and they are informed and influenced by those working around them. If you are striving to find your own style, one of the most powerful exercises you can practice is to find influence and inspiration in the work of those around you, and then emulate that work in an effort to define, shape, and grow your own photographic voice. By collecting, imitating, and eventually reshaping and combining the work of those around you, your unique voice can be found and the quality of your work can soar.In Photograph Like a Thief, photographer, author, and retoucher Glyn Dewis embraces the idea of “stealing” and recreating others’ work in order to improve as an artist. By stepping inside others’ images, you can learn to reverse engineer their creation, then build an image that simultaneously pays homage to that work and is also an original creation itself.Glyn begins by covering the process of "stealing ideas" and finding inspiration. He shares the gear he uses as well as his retouching and post-processing workflow. In a chapter on how to reverse engineer a photograph, Glyn discusses how to read an image by looking at the catch lights, shadow and highlight positions, and the hardness or softness of the shadows. This is a crucial skill to acquire if you want to recreate a specific look.Glyn then works through a series of images—inspired by movies, books, history, and a few legendary photographers—from the initial concept and influence to the final result. For each image, he reverse engineers the shot to describe how it was created, then works through the gear he used, the lighting for the image, and the post-processing of the image in Photoshop—from the RAW out-of-camera shot to the finished piece. While Glyn's work primarily focuses on portraiture, he finds inspiration and influence from a wide variety of work.By working alongside Glyn (he makes all the files available for download), you too can learn to find inspiration all around you, discover how others’ work can influence you, improve your photographic and post-processing skill set, and begin your own journey to defining your unique style. Who knows? Soon, others may be stealing from you.

Take container cluster management to the next level; learn how to administer and configure Kubernetes on CoreOS; and apply suitable management design patterns such as Configmaps, Autoscaling, elastic resource usage, and high availability.  Some of the other features discussed are logging, scheduling, rolling updates, volumes, service types, and multiple cloud provider zones. The atomic unit of modular container service in Kubernetes is a Pod, which is a group of containers with a common filesystem and networking. The Kubernetes Pod abstraction enables design patterns for containerized applications similar to object-oriented design patterns. Containers provide some of the same benefits as software objects such as modularity or packaging, abstraction, and reuse. CoreOS Linux is used in the majority of the chapters and other platforms discussed are CentOS with OpenShift, Debian 8 (jessie) on AWS, and Debian 7 for Google Container Engine.CoreOS is the main focus becayse Docker is pre-installed on CoreOS out-of-the-box. CoreOS:  Supports most cloud providers (including Amazon AWS EC2 and Google Cloud Platform) and virtualization platforms (such as VMWare and VirtualBox)Provides Cloud-Config for declaratively configuring for OS items such as network configuration (flannel), storage (etcd), and user accounts Provides a production-level infrastructure for containerized applications including automation, security, and scalabilityLeads the drive for container industry standards and founded appc Provides the most advanced container registry, Quay  Docker was made available as open source in March 2013 and has become the most commonly used containerization platform.

Erschaffe deine eigene Welt: mächtige neue Waffen erstellen wie z.B. ein Feuerschwert, auf Knopfdruck Türme und ganze Häuser bauen, automatisch auf Veränderungen in der Welt reagierenNeue Crafting-Rezepte und eigene Spielmodi entwickeln wie z.B. eine Schneeballschlacht mit Highscore-ListeMit umfangreicher Referenz zu allen ProgrammierbefehlenDu spielst schon lange Minecraft und denkst, du hast schon alles gesehen? Kennst du schon das Feuerschwert, den Enderbogen oder den Spielmodus »Schneeballschlacht«? Du willst auf Knopfdruck Türme, Mauern oder sogar ganze Häuser bauen? Vollautomatisch auf Geschehnisse in der Spielwelt reagieren? Mit eigenen Plugins kannst du all das und noch viel mehr entdecken und ganz nebenbei auch noch programmieren lernen.Python ist für Programmiereinsteiger besonders leicht zu lernen. Daniel Braun zeigt dir, wie du mit Python und Bukkit oder Spigot Erweiterungen für Minecraft programmierst, sogenannte Plugins, die du dann zusammen mit deinen Freunden auf deinem eigenen Minecraft-Server ausprobieren kannst. Dafür sind keine Vorkenntnisse erforderlich, du lernst alles von Anfang an.Nach dem Programmieren einfacher Chat-Befehle wirst du coole Plugins zum Bauen erstellen, so dass mit einem einzigen Befehl sofort z.B. ein fertiges Haus oder eine Kugel vor dir steht.
Außerdem erfährst du, wie deine Plugins automatisch auf Geschehnisse in der Spielwelt reagieren können.Du kannst auch eigene Crafting-Rezepte entwerfen, um z.B. mächtige neue Waffen zu kreieren wie das Feuerschwert, das alles in Brand setzt, worauf es trifft.
Am Ende lernst du sogar, wie du eigene Spielmodi entwickeln kannst, also ein Spiel im Spiel. Ob eine Schneeballschlacht mit Highscore-Liste oder ein Wettsammeln mit Belohnung für den Sieger, hier ist jede Menge Spaß garantiert.Für das alles brauchst du keine Vorkenntnisse, nur Spaß am Programmieren. Es beginnt mit ganz einfachen Beispielen, aber mit jedem Kapitel lernst du mehr Möglichkeiten kennen, um Minecraft nach deinen Wünschen anzupassen. Am Ende kannst du richtig in Python programmieren und deiner Kreativität sind keine Grenzen mehr gesetzt, um deine eigene Minecraft-Welt zu erschaffen.Aus dem Inhalt:Bukkit und Spigot installieren und einrichtenEigene Befehle definieren und Chat-Nachrichten versendenPython-Grundlagen: Variablen, Schleifen, Verzweigungen, Funktionen, Klassen und ObjekteHäuser, Kreise und Kugeln bauenSchilder errichten und beliebig beschriftenPlugins programmieren, die auf Veränderungen in der Welt reagierenEigene Crafting-Rezepte erstellenInformationen dauerhaft speichernEigene Spielmodi entwickeln wie z.B. eine Schneeballschlacht oder ein SammelspielUmfangreiche Referenz zu allen Programmierbefehlen

Windows Server 2016 optimal einrichten, absichern und in der Praxis einsetzenGrundlagen zu allen Neuerungen und den wichtigsten Features wie PowerShell, Active Directory, Exchange Server, Hyper-V, Apache Webserver und Nano ServerMit vielen Beispielen und Schritt-für Schritt-Anleitungen
Dieses Buch ist der perfekte Begleiter für einen praxisnahen Einstieg in die Administration mit Windows Server 2016 und zeigt, wie Sie das System bestmöglich für sich nutzen können.

In einem ersten Teil wird alles erklärt, was für die ersten Schritte mit Windows Server 2016 wichtig ist: Sie erfahren, welche Kosten auf Sie zukommen, welche Voraussetzungen Ihr System mitbringen muss und wie Sie das System auf dem Server einrichten. Sie lernen den Server-Manager kennen, verwalten Benutzer und Gruppen und erfahren, wie Sie auch von unterwegs und mit beliebigen Geräten auf Windows Server 2016 zugreifen können. Der Autor demonstriert Ihnen anhand von kurzen Skripten, wie Sie auf der PowerShell und mit Cmdlets effektiv und automatisiert arbeiten können. 

Im nächsten Schritt geht Jörg Schieb ins Detail und und veranschaulicht Ihnen, wie Sie mit Windows Server 2016 im Alltag  arbeiten. Er zeigt Ihnen unter anderem, wie Sie Anwendungen, Dienste, Dateien und Ordner für alle Nutzer verfügbar machen und sie zentral verwalten. Sie lernen, Active Directory und Exchange Server 2016 bereitzustellen und optimal zu konfigurieren und machen sich mit den Vorteilen des Apache Webservers auf Windows Server 2016 vertraut.

Der dritte Teil beschäftigt sich mit allen Fragen rund um die Sicherheit Ihres Systems. Wie kann Windows Server 2016 wirksam gegen Bedrohungen geschützt werden? Wie muss die Firewall konfiguriert werden und wie können verfügbare Updates möglichst zeitnah installiert werden? Der Autor demonstriert Ihnen die Vorteile der Server-Virtualisierung und begleitet Sie auf Ihren ersten Schritten bei der Arbeit mit
Hyper-V, mit Containern oder dem Nano Server.
