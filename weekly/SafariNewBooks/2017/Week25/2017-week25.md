Successfully moving an organization forward is a complex task. Historically professional organizations, like the Project Management Institute, have done a fine job of providing best practices and technical tools to support project managers in the field. These tools will continue to be critical in the future. The opportunity now is to add to that body of knowledge by addressing, more completely, the human experience. In reviewing the literature, practitioners and academics alike have noted that committed teams play an important role in creating exceptional project outcomes. What has been missing is the connection between what&#8217;s known about employee engagement and commitment, from a general management perspective, and a practical method to integrate that knowledge with project management tools. This book will provide a comprehensive map for project managers to learn about the human experience during a project.

From turf wars to low morale, most companies attempt to cure what ails them with the latest management fad—and fail. They are treating the symptoms while ignoring the true problem.Success starts with knowing the kind of business you’re really in. Lead Right for Your Company’s Type argues that every enterprise falls into one of four categories as dictated by their customer promise: customized (e.g. ad agency), predictable and dependable (e.g utility company), benevolent (e.g. educational institution), and best in class (e.g. high-tech company like Apple). When leadership practices fit the customer promise and company type, the organization thrives. But apply the wrong practices and the mismatch pulls the enterprise apart. Example after example exposes the fallout:A small arts college destabilized by top-down rules designed for a predictable and dependable companyA mid-tier retail chain derailed by leadership demands for superior products instead of reliably low pricesA software giant brought to its knees by prioritizing profits over innovationInsightful and practical, the book’s proven tools and five-step process will help you diagnose your organization’s ills—and stop them at their source.

Lawler</strong></li><li>Topic: <strong>Innovation</strong></li><li>ISBN: <strong>9781523082520</strong></li><li>Publisher: <strong>Berrett-Koehler Publishers</strong></li></ul>
In this book, preeminent organizational scholar Edward Lawler identifies a comprehensive and integrated set of talent management practices that fit today's rapidly evolving workplace.The world of work has changed dramatically, says Lawler. Organizations now operate in a global environment. New technologies continue to disrupt how, when, and where work is done and should be managed. The workforce is becoming more diverse. Sustainability has joined profitability as a key business goal. All of this has dramatically accelerated the pace of change, making recruiting the best talent—not simply filling positions—an overriding concern. But too many organizations still use a job-based, bureaucratic talent management approach that doesn't take into account how the world has changed. Indeed, a recent study showed that from 1995 to 2016, there was no significant change in the way HR spends its time.Lawler says that talent management has to be reinvented. It needs to be closely linked to the organization's overall strategy. Recruitment and talent management should be driven by the skills and competencies the organization needs for long-term growth. This means talent management requires agile systems that can respond quickly to changing conditions and that take a more individualized approach to evaluating and rewarding performance. And everything talent management does has to be based on evidence, not tradition. Lawler looks at attracting, selecting, developing, rewarding, managing, and organizing talent through this new lens. In today's world, organizations have to constantly reinvent themselves—and talent management must do the same.

Today&#8217;s news media displays an intense fascination with the global economy&#8212;and for good reason. The degree of worldwide economic integration is unprecedented. Rising globalization has lifted living standards and reduced poverty, while foreign markets and new technologies continue to present opportunities for entrepreneurs and corporations. Still, economic shocks can spread across the world in minutes, impacting billions of lives. The political framework supporting globalization is now under scrutiny, and recent elections suggest economic policies may be readjusted in the coming years. This book will help you learn about economics in everyday language, using little or no math, giving you better tools to interpret current events as well as long-term economic and political developments. Modern economics offers a powerful framework for understanding globalization, international trade, and economic growth. You may possess years of hands-on experience dealing with business cycles and foreign competitive pressures, but lack a solid grounding in economic concepts that shed light on the forces of globalization. This book is here to help.

Become the greatest problem solver you can be!Bad problem solving costs individuals and society incalculable amounts of time, money, and sanity. In this book Nat Greene—who's been solving hard problems professionally for over twenty years—shares nine behaviors anyone can adopt to find solutions to even the most seemingly intractable problems.The problem with most problem solving, Greene says, is that it's not problem solving at all: it's guessing. We have an idea of what might work and we try it out. If that doesn't work, we try something else. And so on. It's inefficient at best, and with really hard problems there are simply too many variables for guessing to work. Greene shows you how to adopt the behaviors great problem solvers use to arrive at solutions efficiently—without guessing. He illustrates them with examples ranging from everyday issues like fixing a malfunctioning garage door to stopping frequent breakdowns at a chemical plant (saving millions of dollars) to addressing the scourge of poverty in sub-Saharan Africa. So stop guessing and start solving today!

Unreal Engine was first created for gaming, but it has gone viral amongst multiple non-game communities that are blown away by its capabilities for real-time interactive visualization. However, Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) visualization for architecture, science, and engineering requires skills that most users don’t have, and is based on very different assumptions from videogaming. Unreal Engine 4 for Design Visualization is the first UE4 development guide written for non-gaming professionals and artists, bringing together all the knowledge they need to leverage UE4’s immense power.World-class UE4 expert Thomas B. Shannon first introduces Unreal Engine 4’s components and technical concepts, giving you a strong foundation for all that comes next. Next, he mentors you through the entire process of building outstanding visualization content for your environment, audiences, and customers -- all with realistic, carefully documented, start-to-finish example projects.Reflecting the questions most often asked about visualization with UE4, Shannon addresses issues ranging from data import and processing to lighting, advanced materials, and rendering. Throughout, all content is written from the perspective of visualization users in architecture, engineering, or science, not gaming. All sample project files may be downloaded at a companion website, where you’ll also find bonus video tutorials.
