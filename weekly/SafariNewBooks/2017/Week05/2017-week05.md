Ask any teacher at any level of education – technology engages learners and animates their imagination. Technology stimulates minds in ways that make a profound and lasting difference. Indeed, technology, for many, is the most important new teaching strategy and learning style introduced in the past 50 years. Yet, the discipline is woefully lax in quantifiable and qualitative validation of successful learning outcomes. Learners with basic skills in reading, writing, and arithmetic master those skills better and faster with technology; yet the research is not there to defend how much better or how much faster these skills are acquired. Technology offers educators a way to adapt instruction to the needs of more diverse learners; still, such successes are not generalized across populations or content areas. Learners use technology to acquire and organize information evidence to obtain a higher level of comprehension; but we are not sure why. The purpose of the International Journal of Information and Communication Technology Education (IJICTE) is to grow this body of research, propose new applications of technology for teaching and learning, and document those practices that contribute irrefutable verification of information technology education as a discipline.This issue contains the following articles:Generic E-Assessment Process Development based on Reverse EngineeringInstitutional Repositories in Universities in Nigeria: Desirability and ProgressConstruct Reliability and Validity of the Shortened Version of the Information-Seeking Behavior ScaleCloud Computing as a Catalyst in STEM EducationThe Effects of Faculty Status, Faculty Gender, Field of Study, and Class Size on the Use of Blogs, Wikis, and Discussion BoardsAn Evaluation Framework for Selecting Collaboration Systems for Student TeamworkFactors Affecting Students' Adoption of ICT Tools in Higher Education Institutions: An Indian Context

World populations are increasing, as are pathogens capable of causing human disease. These infectious diseases contribute to global &#8220;wicked problems.&#8221; As infection numbers rise, and dangerous pathogens evolve, the complexity of these problems increase. Current biotechnological advances can be used to design more effective methods of combatting infectious diseases. This text, Biotechnology and Infectious Disease, will document a core set of infectious agents, as a method of describing ways to update diagnostic and therapeutic tools. The book begins with an introduction to the pathogenic mechanisms displayed by various diseases. Pathogen descriptions of are followed up by such topics as use assays for low-level detection, application of nanosized agents for drug delivery, and design of vaccines for emerging infections, including Ebola and Zika. New technologies are being developed as fast as infectious evolve. The key to taming these wicked pathogens will be in finding commonalities between organisms and applying biotechnological advances.

Data science projects are not so straight-forward in practice. Many hands-on books describe various parts of the process in such a way that you may come to expect everything to go about smoothly and insights to naturally come out from your analyses. However, when you try to apply all this know-how in your own projects, you often end up with bugs in the code and making various mistakes in the process, without realizing it. Even though a colleague can help you pinpoint certain issues in your project, it is often the case that you need to find the majority of them on your own - and fix them. This video helps you get a better perspective of what are the most common problems you’ll encounter when working on a data science project. This know-how, along with some hands-on experience can help you eliminate these bugs that most data scientists face at one point or another, and make the whole process smoother and more enjoyable.
We will cover:An overview of the data science process, including where bugs and mistakes are introduced and can be found
 Types of programming bugs, including indexing and values issues
 Common mistakes in the data science process, including sampling issues, identifying the wrong metrics, overfitting problems, and unnecessary assumptions
 Strategies for coping with bugs, including documentation consultation and unit testing
 Strategies for coping with more high-level issues

Organizations can implement their Business Intelligence solution automatically, based on corporate data models and business rules. No programming or coding is needed anymore, nor is technical modeling of optimized structures for Data Warehouses and Data Marts Databases. This saves time and money, and increases quality and consistency. In general, modelers are working on Staff-level. They define the model, business rules, meta-data, etc. They hand it over to different IT teams, including BI / DW teams. The BI / DW teams start to work and, at best, use the document from Staff as a guideline. They often lose track with the model and start making changes without any alignment to the model anymore.
Model-Driven Data Warehousing solves these issues. Based on the model, the complete implementation (Design of Data Warehouse (3NF and/or Data Vault) and Data Marts (Star-schemas), plus the generation and execution of ETL-code) is automated. And when changes need to apply, a simple “update” of the model adjusts the Data Warehouse automatically.
Creating a logical data model gives you a Data Warehouse in just a few clicks. With consistent management information available, technical complexity and challenges are no longer delaying your business advantage. Better alignment between the business and IT can also be achieved through this model-driven approach. From a Corporate perspective this will bring more control and consistency at the implementation of business rules, meta-data standards and correct definitions of KPIs. From a developer’s perspective the backlog of work is decreased, unsatisfied and impatient customers are no longer frustrated, and you don’t have to redo your own work over and over for each change. The technical, time-consuming and error-prone activities are automated for you.
You finally have achieved an agile Data Warehouse: Flexible, Incremental, Fast, Cost effective. With shorter time to market due to the efficiency and productivity improvements, you gain a significant competitive advantage. Data modeling not only ensures that your business intelligence solution will be built more quickly and effectively, but that the underlying information that drives them is correct and fully documented. Usher in a new era in Data Warehouse automation by automatically designing and generating the Enterprise Data Warehouse code for Third Normal Form and/or Data Vault as well as Star Schema data marts and staged data for Business Intelligence projects.

Recorded live at Data Modeling Zone 2016 (www.DataModelingZone.com).
In his 2009 TED talk, Tim Berners-Lee (a.k.a. The Father of the Web) urged us onward toward a compelling vision for the next Web - a "Semantic Web".
"It's called Linked Data," he said. "I want you to make it. I want you to demand it." 
But what is Linked Data? Why is it valuable? How does it work? And how can you use it to advance your organization with the work you do? 
Briefly described, Linked Data, is a method of modeling and publishing structured data so that it can be interlinked and become more useful through semantic queries. Linked Data proposes to turn the existing Web of hyperlinked documents, which are mostly made for people to read, into a Web of linked data that better enables computers and people to work in cooperation. It simplifies the publishing and integration of data and it can solve a host of classic I.T. problems within your organization and on a global scale. Linked Data can change the way you think about how to model, create, share, and integrate data. 
In this gentle, step-wise, and comprehensive presentation, you'll learn essential concepts - the most important things you need to know. Those new to this topic will walk away with a fresh new perspective and a whole new toolbox for solving problems. Those familiar to the topic are sure to glean new insights, best-practices, and lessons-learned. In addition to learning about the "what, why and how", you will learn about:
Essential W3C standards such as the Resource Description Framework (RDF)
The SPARQL Query Language (SQL for the Semantic Web)
OWL - The Web Ontology Language and Ontology Modeling
“Triple-store” Graph Databases
Pre-existing (reusable) Vocabularies
Linked Open Data sources that you can find and leverage on the Web
Free, Open Source, and Commercial Tools Available for Use.

This book critically analyzes the concept of strategic management accounting, the implications this emerging paradigm will have on the accounting profession, and the ramifications for businesses at large. This research examines current literature, and illustrates these concepts with current market examples. This manuscript approaches the topic in a way that is unique by linking the concept of SMA to the integrated reporting framework. In essence, strategic management accounting is a theory with broad-based support, but the IR framework and reporting structure provides a vehicle through which progress, costs, and benefits of a more strategic accounting function can be evaluated. Focusing on principles, primarily for internal management utilization, the following provides an outline and summary of concepts and techniques that can be used to elevate the role of the management accounting function. Whether you are a management expert, an accounting professional, or simply someone looking to keep up to date with emerging business trends, this text provides the content, and action-oriented steps to meet those expectations.

Global markets and competition have forced companies to operate in a physically distributed environment to take the advantage of benefits of strategic alliances between partnering firms. Earlier, information systems such as Material Requirements Planning (MRP), Computer-Aided Design (CAD) and Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAM) have widely been used for functional integration within an organization. With global operations in place, there is a need for suitable Enterprise Information Systems (EIS) such as Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and E-Commerce (EC) for the integration of extended enterprises along the supply chain with the objective of achieving flexibility and responsiveness. Companies all over the world spend billions of dollars in the design and implementation of EIS in particular ERP systems such as Oracle, Peoplesoft, SAP, JD Edwards and BAAN with the objective of achieving an integrated global supply chain. Inter-organizational information systems play a major role in improving communication and integration between partnering firms to achieve an integrated global supply chain. There is a growing demand for research and applications that will provide insights into issues, challenges, and solutions related to the successful applications and management aspects of EIS.This issue contains the following articles:Maximizing the Value of Packaged Software Customization: A Nonlinear Model and SimulationExamining the Contributing Factors for Cloud Computing Adoption in a Developing CountryTowards Understanding the Determinants of Employees' E -Learning Adoption in Workplace: A Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) ViewDesign and Implementation of Multi-Agent Online Auction Systems in Cloud ComputingAssessing Organizational Readiness for Implementing ERP System Using Fuzzy Expert System Approach

This IBM® Redbooks® publication helps you with the
planning, installation, and configuration of the new IBM
Spectrum™ Archive (formerly IBM Linear Tape File
System™ (LTFS)) Enterprise Edition (EE) V1.2.2.0 for the IBM
TS3310, IBM TS3500, and IBM TS4500 tape libraries. IBM Spectrum
Archive™ EE enables the use of the LTFS for the policy
management of tape as a storage tier in an IBM Spectrum
Scale™ (formerly IBM General Parallel File System
(GPFS™)) based environment and helps encourage the use of
tape as a critical tier in the storage environment. This is the
third edition of IBM Spectrum Archive V1.2 (SG24-8333-00) although
it is based on the prior editions of IBM Linear Tape File System
Enterprise Edition V1.1.1.2: Installation and Configuration Guide,
SG24-8143.IBM Spectrum Archive EE can run any application that is designed
for disk files on a physical tape media. IBM Spectrum Archive EE
supports the IBM Linear Tape-Open (LTO) Ultrium 7, 6, and 5 tape
drives in IBM TS3310, TS3500, and TS4500 tape libraries. Also, IBM
TS1140 and IBM TS1150 tape drives are supported in TS3500 and
TS4500 tape library configurations.IBM Spectrum Archive EE can play a major role in reducing the
cost of storage for data that does not need the access performance
of primary disk. The use of IBM Spectrum Archive EE to replace
disks with physical tape in tier 2 and tier 3 storage can improve
data access over other storage solutions because it improves
efficiency and streamlines management for files on tape. IBM
Spectrum Archive EE simplifies the use of tape by making it
transparent to the user and manageable by the administrator under a
single infrastructure.This publication is intended for anyone who wants to understand
more about IBM Spectrum Archive EE planning and implementation.
This book is suitable for IBM clients, IBM Business Partners, IBM

Although Europe’s cohesion policy plays an important role in European regional and structural politics, its effectiveness and utility have been viewed with great skepticism. Because earlier studies have not adequately account for the mode of action of capital assistance, this study uses a political-economic perspective to analyze the weak points in the Regional Policy of the European Union.

Diese Arbeit befasst sich mit den Gründen für die Herausbildung der politischen und wirtschaftlichen Strukturen in Russland, die als „Oligarchie" bezeichnet werden. Dazu werden aus einer institutionenökonomischen Sicht „ordnende Potenzen" in der Annahme unterschieden, dass diese auf drei verschiedenen Ebenen ihre Wirksamkeit entfalten können: auf der Ebene formaler Institutionen (Gesetze und andere Rechtsnormen), auf der Ebene informaler Institutionen (Traditionen, Gewohnheiten, Werte) und auf der Ebene der individuellen Wahrnehmung. Die Ebenen stehen untereinander in wechselseitigen Beziehungen; je nach Art dieser Beziehungen werden verschiedene Ordnungsfaktoren für die Individuen handlungsleitend. Daraus folgen charakteristische Merkmale des russischen Sonderwegs der Transformation. Ausgehend vom Wechsel der formalen Institutionen wird die institutionenökonomische Sichtweise vertieft (Kapitel 2) und ergänzt (Kapitel 3), um ein möglichst belastbares theoretisches Fundament für die Analyse Russlands (Kapitel 4) zu erhalten. Es wird gezeigt, dass der russische Sonderweg keiner Zwangsläufigkeit unterliegt, sondern durch Machtinteressen begründet ist. Die Lektüre ist für den ordnungs- bzw. institutionenökonomisch interessierten wie auch für den an Russland interessierten Leser zu empfehlen.

An H(b) space is defined as a collection of analytic functions that are in the image of an operator. The theory of H(b) spaces bridges two classical subjects, complex analysis and operator theory, which makes it both appealing and demanding. Volume 1 of this comprehensive treatment is devoted to the preliminary subjects required to understand the foundation of H(b) spaces, such as Hardy spaces, Fourier analysis, integral representation theorems, Carleson measures, Toeplitz and Hankel operators, various types of shift operators and Clark measures. Volume 2 focuses on the central theory. Both books are accessible to graduate students as well as researchers: each volume contains numerous exercises and hints, and figures are included throughout to illustrate the theory. Together, these two volumes provide everything the reader needs to understand and appreciate this beautiful branch of mathematics.

Infinitary logic, the logic of languages with infinitely long conjunctions, plays an important role in model theory, recursion theory and descriptive set theory. This book is the first modern introduction to the subject in forty years, and will bring students and researchers in all areas of mathematical logic up to the threshold of modern research. The classical topics of back-and-forth systems, model existence techniques, indiscernibles and end extensions are covered before more modern topics are surveyed. Zilber's categoricity theorem for quasiminimal excellent classes is proved and an application is given to covers of multiplicative groups. Infinitary methods are also used to study uncountable models of counterexamples to Vaught's conjecture, and effective aspects of infinitary model theory are reviewed, including an introduction to Montalbán's recent work on spectra of Vaught counterexamples. Self-contained introductions to effective descriptive set theory and hyperarithmetic theory are provided, as is an appendix on admissible model theory.

Can you tell the difference between talking to a human and talking to a machine? Or, is it possible to create a machine which is able to converse like a human? In fact, what is it that even makes us human? Turing's Imitation Game, commonly known as the Turing Test, is fundamental to the science of artificial intelligence. Involving an interrogator conversing with hidden identities, both human and machine, the test strikes at the heart of any questions about the capacity of machines to behave as humans. While this subject area has shifted dramatically in the last few years, this book offers an up-to-date assessment of Turing's Imitation Game, its history, context and implications, all illustrated with practical Turing tests. The contemporary relevance of this topic and the strong emphasis on example transcripts makes this book an ideal companion for undergraduate courses in artificial intelligence, engineering or computer science.

This is a comprehensive introduction to the brand new theory of conic finance, also referred to as the two-price theory, which determines bid and ask prices in a consistent and fundamentally motivated manner. Whilst theories of one price classically eliminate all risk, the concept of acceptable risks is critical to the foundations of the two-price theory which sees risk elimination as typically unattainable in a modern financial economy. Practical examples and case studies provide the reader with a comprehensive introduction to the fundamentals of the theory, a variety of advanced quantitative models, and numerous real-world applications, including portfolio theory, option positioning, hedging, and trading contexts. This book offers a quantitative and practical approach for readers familiar with the basics of mathematical finance to allow them to boldly go where no quant has gone before.

Compact data structures help represent data in reduced space while allowing it to be queried, navigated, and operated in compressed form. They are essential tools for efficiently handling massive amounts of data by exploiting the memory hierarchy. They also reduce the resources needed in distributed deployments and make better use of the limited memory in low-end devices. The field has developed rapidly, reaching a level of maturity that allows practitioners and researchers in application areas to benefit from the use of compact data structures. This first comprehensive book on the topic focuses on the structures that are most relevant for practical use. Readers will learn how the structures work, how to choose the right ones for their application scenario, and how to implement them. Researchers and students in the area will find in the book a definitive guide to the state of the art in compact data structures.

I will help you think about the aspects of CSS development that become the most difficult part of writing CSS in larger projects.You'll learn about the problems of authoring CSS at scale—including specificity, the cascade and styles intrinsically tied to document structure. I'll introduce you to the ECSS methodology, and show you how to develop consistent and enforceable selector naming conventions. We'll cover how to apply ECSS to your web applications and visual model, and how you can organize your project structure wisely, and handle visual state changes with ARIA, providing greater accessibility considerations. In addition, we'll take a deep look into CSS tooling and process considerations. Finally we will address performance considerations by examining topics such as CSS selector speed with hard data and browser-representative insight.Style and approachLearn with me, Ben Frain, about how to really think about CSS. This is a book to deal with writing CSS for large-scale, rapidly changing web projects and applications. This isn't a book about writing CSS, as in the stuff inside the curly braces - this is a book about the organisation and architecture of CSS; the parts outside the braces!Downloading the example code for this book.

The toy industry is one of the most consistently misunderstood sectors of American business, comprising a wide range of businesses under one banner-entertainment, commodities, fashion and licensing-that each behave differently. Broad-based change is constant, with more than 40 percent of toy products new each year. The U.S. market comprises about 600 publicly and privately held companies, valued at about $22 billion per year at wholesale for traditional toys, which has remained relatively constant since the 1990s. It is also the only industry where success depends on the whims of a child. This book is a concise and in-depth introduction to the structure, practices, and market forces that impact the toy industry, including a short history, a description of the current market landscape, product trends, emerging opportunities and threats and expectations for the future, as well as aspects of retailing, consumer behavior, and financial markets. While the book's primary focus is the U.S. toy industry, one cannot ignore the global scope of the business, particularly related to manufacturing, growth potential and emerging markets. It is intended to provide a foundation for understanding the diverse and dynamic nature of the toy industry and many things that make it unique and to provide an introduction to this fast-paced, always changing and fiercely competitive business where success is often more an art than a science.

Cost-Effective Energy Efficient Building Retrofitting:Materials, Technologies, Optimization and Case Studies provides essential knowledge for civil engineers, architects, and other professionals working in the field of cost-effective energy efficient building retrofitting.The building sector is responsible for high energy consumption and its global demand is expected to grow as each day there are approximately 200,000 new inhabitants on planet Earth. The majority of electric energy will continue to be generated from the combustion of fossil fuels releasing not only carbon dioxide, but also methane and nitrous oxide. Energy efficiency measures are therefore crucial to reduce greenhouse gas emissions of the building sector. Energy efficient building retrofitting needs to not only be technically feasible, but also economically viable. New building materials and advanced technologies already exist, but the knowledge to integrate all active components is still scarce and far from being widespread among building industry stakeholders.Emphasizes cost-effective methods for the refurbishment of existing buildings, presenting state-of-the-art technologiesIncludes detailed case studies that explain various methods and Net Zero EnergyExplains optimal analysis and prioritization of cost effective strategies

This book will examine the problem of under-represented populations (URPs) in the so-called &#8220;STEM&#8221; fields: science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, this problem is especially acute in computer science. Who are these under-represented populations? What creates them? And finally, why should there be concern about URPs in STEM? This book brings to light the crisis of a dearth of women, especially minority women, in STEM. The text highlights what has combined to create the perfect storm of impending economic stagnation, impoverished populations, diminished innovation, and lack of interest in choosing these fields. The author discusses what must be done to correct this social injustice and stave off losing America&#8217;s status one of the leaders in technological innovation and economic opportunity.

  Large Scale Network Design LiveLessons takes you through the concepts behind stable, scalable, elegant network design, including modularity, resilience, layering, and security principles. This livelesson will focus on traditional distributed link state, distance vector, and path vector routing protocols, as well as the basic principles of centralized control planes (such as OpenFlow). A special point will be made of sorting out the relationship between policy and reachability, and where they can best be managed in a large scale network.This video begins with an examination of basic network design principles, including an examination of modularization, hierarchy, summarization, aggregation, and resilience. More advanced foundational topics are then considered, such as an overview of network complexity, network models, and policy from within the context of the control plane. After this, the series will work through design using each of the distributed control planes, including OSPF, IS-IS, EIGRP, and BGP, on several network topologies to provide practical knowledge of actual deployment in real networks. The following section of this livelesson will consider the tradeoffs around programmable networks, including convergence, stability, and other factors. Finally, advanced topics, such as fast convergence, will be considered in detail, from principle to application in each protocol.About the InstructorsRuss White has more than 20 years of experience in designing, deploying, breaking, and troubleshooting large-scale networks.

Re-architect relational applications to NoSQL, integrate relational database management systems with the Hadoop ecosystem, and transform and migrate relational data to and from Hadoop components. This book covers the best-practice design approaches to re-architecting your relational applications and transforming your relational data to optimize concurrency, security, denormalization, and performance. Winner of IBM’s 2012 Gerstner Award for his implementation of big data and data warehouse initiatives and author of Practical Hadoop Security, author Bhushan Lakhe walks you through the entire transition process. First, he lays out the criteria for deciding what blend of re-architecting, migration, and integration between RDBMS and HDFS best meets your transition objectives. Then he demonstrates how to design your transition model. Lakhe proceeds to cover the selection criteria for ETL tools, the implementation steps for migration with SQOOP- and Flume-based data transfers, and transition optimization techniques for tuning partitions, scheduling aggregations, and redesigning ETL. Finally, he assesses the pros and cons of data lakes and Lambda architecture as integrative solutions and illustrates their implementation with real-world case studies. Hadoop/NoSQL solutions do not offer by default certain relational technology features such as role-based access control, locking for concurrent updates, and various tools for measuring and enhancing performance. Practical Hadoop Migration shows how to use open-source tools to emulate such relational functionalities in Hadoop ecosystem components.

Do you really understand what business value is? Information technology can and should deliver business value. But the Agile literature has paid scant attention to what business value means and how to know whether or not you are delivering it. This problem becomes ever more critical as you push value delivery toward autonomous teams and away from requirements ?tossed over the wall? by business stakeholders. An empowered team needs to understand its goal!Playful and thought-provoking, The Art of Business Value explores what business value means, why it matters, and how it should affect your software development and delivery practices. More than any other IT delivery approach, DevOps (and Agile thinking in general) makes business value a central concern. This book examines the role of business value in software and makes a compelling case for why a clear understanding of business value will change the way you deliver software.This book will make you think deeply about not only what it means to deliver value but also the relationship of the IT organization to the rest of the enterprise. It will give you the language to discuss value with the business, methods to cut through bureaucracy, and strategies for incorporating Agile teams and culture into the enterprise. Most of all, this book will startle you into new ways of thinking about the cutting-edge of Agile practice and where it may lead.

All programs are controlled by a program. And programs are written and controlled by humans. This course is a basic course covering the basic considerations of writing, debugging, and executing a program. We will cover: Data Conversion. Occasionally, an organization will need to take an old data warehouse and refurbish it or reconstruct it. We cover both data deletion and conversion. We emphasize the importance of an up-to-date and accurate data model, as well as the role of the archival environment.
 CRUD Matrixes. Learn about the CRUD matrix, a useful form of analysis for information systems. Normally, systems are formed so that several programs work together to perform analysis. In some cases there are many programs that constitute a system. Keeping things organized, without loss of discipline or rigor can get difficult. In cases like this, it’s often useful to create a C.R.U.D. chart: C – Create , R – Read, U – Update, and D – Delete. We explore the various forms of a CRUD matrix, as well as its purpose.
 Data Flow Diagrams (DFD). Learn about the Data Flow Diagrams (DFD), one of the more important, more useful techniques of basic analysis. We explore the different approaches to breaking down systems into functional components.
 Flowcharts. Flowcharts are one of the basic analytical tools used by programmers. Learn about flowcharts in this segment including understanding how a program is going to work. A flowchart describes the logic inside a program, from one instruction to the next. The more complex the program, the more useful the flow chart.
 Functional Decompositions. When looking at a large process or a function, it’s often difficult to understand all interactions happening at once. For the purpose of automating (or managing) a large process or function, it’s necessary to understand what is happening. Functional decomposition starts with the statement of the purpose or function that is to be analyzed. Next the broad process is broken down into its major sub functions. Then major functions are broken down into their component parts.
 Gantt Charts. Whenever building large projects, many activities need to be done at once. This is where Gantt charts, the subject of this segment, are useful. Gantt charts are used on a regular basis to manage large projects for many reasons. They are a normal part of any project for management, planning and control. One of the major challenges of large projects is the scheduling of the activities involved with the project in an orderly fashion. Gantt charts organize all activities needed to be done on a timeline.
 Heuristic Analysis. This segment covers heuristic analysis, projects where the activities are entirely unpredictable. Some of the most interesting and valuable results have come from heuristic projects.
 HIPO Charts. HIPO charts are an analytical tool used to understand what is going on in a program at a high level. We cover all of the parts of a HIPO chart in this segment, including inputs, outputs,  and screens.
 Iterative Development. We cover what iterative development is and why it is a very useful approach to software development.

Reality-based modeling for today's unique economic recoveryEconomic Modeling in the Post Great Recession Era presents a more realistic approach to modeling, using direct statistical applications to address the characteristics and trends central to current market behaviors. This book's unique focus on the reality of today's markets makes it an invaluable resource for students and practitioners seeking a comprehensive guide to more accurate forecasting. While most books treat the economy as if it were in a vacuum, building models around idealized or perception-biased behaviors, this book deals with the economy as it currently stands—in a state of recovery, limited by financial constraints, imperfect information, and lags and disparities in price movements. The authors identify how these characteristics impact various markets' behaviors, and quantify those behaviors using SAS as the primary statistical tool. Today's economy bears a number of unique attributes that usual modeling methods fail to consider. This book describes how to approach modeling based on real-world, observable data in order to make better-informed decisions in toady's markets. Discover the three economic characteristics with the greatest impact on various marketsCreate economic models that mirror the current post-recession realityAdopt statistical methods that identify and adapt to structural breaks and lagsFactor real-world imperfections into modeling for more accurate forecastingThe past few years have shown a clear demarcation between policymakers' forecasts and actual outcomes. As the dust settles on the Great Recession, after-effects linger—and impact our current recovery in ways that diverge from past experience and theoretical expectations. Economic Modeling in the Post Great Recession Era provides comprehensive guidance grounded in reality for today's economic decision-makers.
