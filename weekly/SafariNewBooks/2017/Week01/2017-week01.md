In addition to step-by-step guidance toward assessment, planning, and implementation, the book offers:A diagnostic tool for leaders, teams, and organizations to assess their starting place, and highlight the specific areas needed to improve the ability to accelerate performance.A detailed look at the factors proven to create drag—and drive—at each of the four levels: strategy, organizations, teams, and individuals.An exploration of the 39 differentiating actions that organizations can combine as dictated by their strategy and context into a winning recipe.A closer look at the practices of 23 “superaccelerators,” a global (and perhaps unexpected) mix of companies that have demonstrated a consistent ability to accelerate performance.A single taste of success is all it takes to spark change, but the hard work of following through requires constant vigilance—and a plan. Learn how to capture that drive, bottle it, and use it to sustain motivation, inspiration, and achievement. Deliver at the highest level, and then turn around and do even better next time. Accelerating Performance gives leaders a step-by-step framework for taking action and transforming their organizations, teams, and even themselves—starting today.

Modern cities are increasingly involving citizens in decisions that affect them. This trend is a part of a movement toward a new standard of city management and planning&#8212;falling under the names public involvement, public engagement, collaborative governance, civic renewal, participatory democracy, and citizen-centered change. City administrators have long focused on attaining excellence in their technical domains; they are now expected to achieve an equal standard of excellence in public involvement. Toward this end, Citizen-Centered Cities provides a body of experience about public involvement that would take years for municipal administrators to accumulate on the job. The opening chapter summarizes nine challenges for public involvement, together with over sixty aspirational recommendations. Subsequent chapters provide detailed case studies illustrating these challenges for a range of projects&#8212;a new bridge, a light rail line, a highway interchange, neighborhood street modifications, urban streetscaping, bicycle routes, movement of freight, and a transportation master plan. The close government-academic cooperation required to carry out this project builds on an innovative partnership between the City of Edmonton and the University of Alberta called the Center for Public Involvement.

The way that programmers control a program is through language. This course is on the basics of how language relates to computer processing. We will cover: Language Basics. So how does code get written? There are many styles, but the following is an approximation of how programmers produce code: 1) Determine input, output, and algorithms, 2) Enter code on keyboard, 3) Desk check code, 4) Compile code into an executable format, 5) Unit test code with simple input and output, 6) Integrate test with other modules, and 7) Analyze results and see what changes need to be made. After you analyze the results you can go back and make corrections wherever needed. Code exists in two separate forms: source code and executable code. The compiler takes the source code and converts it into an executable code.
 Language Constructs. Each computer language is different. Some things are typical of every computer language some of the common constructs, including language constructs, assignment statements, if-then-else statements, do until/while loops, and call procedures.
 Language Conundrums. There are many ways to create faulty coding. Some of the more obvious ways that are discussed in this segment include the infinite loop, deadly embrace, buffering read statement, and locking large amounts of data without periodically releasing some or all of the data.
 Language Debugging. We cover the steps in language debugging including identifying the error, finding the line of code the error occurred in, locating the data the system was working on at the moment of error, repeating the error to verify what is happening, isolating the data and the code that caused the error, inserting special messages showing what variables had what value, making sure you can see what has been executing, and enlisting the aid of an experienced person.
 Language Dynamics of Execution. Most programmers look at the code from the standpoint of purity of logic, such as “Does the code do what it is supposed to do?” This segment covers dynamics of execution as well as the different performance dynamics associated with each line of code. 
 Language Example. We cover the basic logic in a typical computer language. We start with the first activity of accessing a record and finding values, then inserting and deleting records.
 Language History. Computer languages have been around a short time but have an interesting past with an evolutionary impact on other languages. This segment covers from the beginning where there was a computer, and in order to make the computer do anything useful it was necessary to program the computer in machine language. We cover the first forms of input, which were punch cards, paper tape, and wire boards. Then move on to assembler, ForTran (FORmula TRANslation), COBOL (COmmon Business Oriented Language), PL1 (Programming Language 1 by IBM), SQL (Structured Query Language), and FOCUS (a fourth generation language by IBI). We also cover some of the modern languages including C, C++, vb.net, and Java.
 Language Management. A different level of skill is required to manage code than is needed to write code. This segment covers language management, including the two types of code: source code and executable code.

Other professions are much older than the computer profession. There are notes from an accountant on the pyramids. There are street of Rome that were designed two millennia ago. There are skeletons in Chile that suggest that medicine was performed over 10,000 years ago. Yet the profession of technology and computers started in the 1950’s, making it a very young profession. This course is on some of the people and some of the advances made in technology in its short history.  We will cover: A Brief History of Computer Science, from the 1940s through 2007. 
 Billion Dollar Chip. We cover semiconductor manufacturing including the design and testing and manufacturing of the chip.
 Moore’s Law. We discuss the famous rule by Gordon Moore, chairman of Intel Corporation. He said “The number of transistors in an integrated circuit doubles every 2 years.”  Moore’s law has been extended to storage, processors, and other electronics.
 Zachman Framework. From the early days of structured programming and analysis design the need for discipline and organization of systems development was a recurring theme. The Zachman Framework, discussed in this segment, provides this structure. Prior to the seminal work done by John Zachman, the emphasis in information systems development was on software development. John Zachman introduced the first steps leading away from writing programs to a rigorous design approach.

In our distant past, we attempted to create wealth by turning everyday substances into gold. This was early alchemy, and ultimately it did not work. But the world has changed. Today we have a type of "modern alchemy" that really can create gold. We can transform voluminous text into a wealth of knowledge.
Text is a common fabric of society, yet it is still challenging for our technology to make sense of text. This is where taxonomies can help. In this book, legendary Bill Inmon will introduce you to the concept of taxonomies and how they are used to simplify and understand text. We emphasize the practical aspects of taxonomies, and the subsequent usage of taxonomies as a basis for textual analytics. 
This book is for managers who have to deal with text, students of computer science, programmers who need to understand taxonomies, systems analysts who hope to draw business value out of a body of text, and especially those who are struggling to decode data lakes.  Hopefully for those individuals (and many more), this book will serve as both an introduction to taxonomies and a guide to how taxonomies can be used to bring text into the realm of corporate decision-making. 
This book will introduce you to the world of taxonomies, as well as explore:
Simple and complex taxonomies
Ontologies
Obtaining taxonomies
Changing taxonomies
Taxonomies and data models
Types of textual data
Textual analytics.
In addition, several case studies are presented from industries as diverse as banking, call centers, and travel.

We all need to think more like entrepreneurs. Seeking and seizing opportunities, boldly taking risks, quickly changing course—achieving success today requires the kind of action-first, fake-it-‘til-you-make-it ethos celebrated in the tech industry.This formula is not typically a female one. Women tend to be cautious. We overthink our next moves, become paralyzed by fear, and simply don’t act. We might be safer . . . but we’re also stuck.But, what if women embraced the startup model? What if we had the confidence to take chances, even if we knew we may fail fabulously? What if instead of agonizing over which step to take, we leapt forward quickly? Fearless and Free empowers women, showing us how we can all use lessons from Silicon Valley to pivot in our careers—and unlock a world of possibilities.Author Wendy Sachs talked to a wide range of women who faced down fears, roadblocks, and failures…to reinvent themselves. Spanning industries and ages—from media maven Jill Abramson to Aminatou Sow of the Tech LadyMafia—the book weaves their insights and experiences together with current research and actionable advice. You’ll learn how to:Capitalize on your skills and expand themGrow comfortable with being uncomfortableSell your storyEngineer serendipityNurture your networkShake off setbacksBrand yourself—without braggingBuild momentumCompete with digital nativesAnd moreBeing disciplined is no match for being disruptive. Whether you want out of a shrinking industry or into a business of your own creation, Fearless and Free helps you dream big—and act now.

Managers want great teams, but most build them around decades-old ideas and practices made popular by companies that have lost their edge.Extreme Teams looks at the new generation of teams driving growth in today’s most innovative firms. They do this by doing things differently: hiring the right person instead of the best person; focusing on one priority while leaving room to explore new ideas; creating an environment where people are comfortable dealing with the uncomfortable; and maximizing profit by not making profit what matters most.The book takes you inside top companies and examines the teamwork experiments powering their results, including how:Pixar’s teams use constant feedback and debate to transform initially flawed films into billion-dollar hitsA culture of radical “freedom and responsibility” helps Netflix execute on the next big thingWhole Food’s super-autonomous teams embrace hard metrics and friendly competition to drive performanceZappos fuels the weirdness and fun that sustains its successTimes change, and so must teams.

Take your web applications to the next level by leveraging the power of Flux architecture using the Redux framework  About This VideoGet to know the essentials of building single page applications with React and ReduxQuickly and elegantly solve common problems including form submission and list paginationLeverage powerful libraries to test every aspect of your client’s applicationIn DetailRedux completes the missing piece of the React framework, and is used at the core of React for most complex React projects. In this course, we’ll be focusing on leveraging the Redux framework to impose better engineering on React applications. Redux is an implementation of FLUX, which is a pattern for managing application state in React. Redux brings a clean and testable design to the table using a purely functional approach.The course begins with the basics of React development, where you will get a better understanding of how React applications are organized compared to other JavaScript applications. Then you will learn the principles of the Flux architecture before diving into one of its most popular implementations: Redux. You’ll build a simple React application and rewrite it with Redux. By the end of this section, our Redux code will be doing all the work so that our React components can be strictly presentational.Moving on, we’ll turn our simple client into a single page application. We’ll use react-router to allow different URLs to render different pages, and you’ll see how to break up our application state into groups of related data. We’ll focus on retrieving lists of records from the server and paginating them, starting by leveraging the Redux framework to implement our own pagination. Then we’ll replace most of the code we’ve written so far, with a third-party package that neatly solves the problem of form submission for us.After that, you’ll submit the form with axios, use react-router to redirect on success, and leverage toastr to display error notifications. Finally, we’ll rip out most of our code and replace it with a popular library that’s built to manage form state. At the end, you will focus on testing different libraries for our React components, and then test our asynchronous action creators and reducers.

Over time the architecture of data warehouse has evolved towards an architecture known as Data Warehouse (DW) 2.0. In DW 2.0 there have been several advances  including the inclusion of unstructured data into the data warehouse, the need for a formal and enterprise wide inclusion of corporate metadata. This course includes an overview to DW 2.0 including: 

An introduction to DW 2.0. We explore the traditional definition of a data warehouse as subject oriented, integrated, non-volatile, and time variant. We also explore the demands of unstructured data on the data warehouse and what makes the DW 2.0 architecture both unique and powerful. 
The DW 2.0 Lifecycle. Data can start off as interactive which is very current (up to the second), then integrated (current, hours to 5 years), then near line (less than current to over five years), and finally archival (older than five years).
 Archival within DW 2.0. We cover archival, which is when the primary usage of the data is done (that is, probability of access is low) yet the data still needs to be maintained by the organization. Data stored in archive can originate from the big data arena and contain both structured and unstructured data. Metadata is physically and tightly coupled with the data that resides in the archival sector. Data may be periodically retrieved from archival on a project basis for deeper analysis.
 DW 2.0 Components. We explore each component of the data warehouse architecture including applications, procedures, programs, databases, and transactions. The structures within DW 2.0 are organized by subject area such as Customer and Product. We will also discuss the Operational Data Store (ODS).
 DW 2.0 Database Design. The DW 2.0 contains different types of data. Therefore, there are different ways to do database design, which are covered within this video segment. We discuss the Interactive Sector, which demands a two to three second response time and 24 x 7 availability. The Integrated Sector of the architecture contains lots of data with this data being used for many different purposes. There is a heavy amount of indexing within the integrated sector. We also explore data mining within the integrated sector. With data mining the requirements are not provided or known, and usually the design resembles a spreadsheet in the form of flat records.  We also discuss exploration processing and the role of historical data.	
 DW 2.0 Integrated Design. We cover the integrated sector of DW 2.0 in detail. This part of the architecture is granular, non-redundant, historical, and represents a single version of truth. This sector presents a corporate perspective of information.
 DW 2.0 Interactive Sector. We cover the interactive sector of DW 2.0 in detail. Within this part of the architecture direct updating and loading of data occur. The interactive sector handles queries where high performance is demanded such as real time data warehousing. No historical integrity of data is maintained and data may not be integrated inside the interactive sector.
 DW 2.0 Linkage. In this segment we cover the linkage between both structured and unstructured data. Some linkages are strong while others are weak. We cover external keys which are a powerful form of linkages. There’s no right or wrong way to implement links. They can be linked on the fly or ahead of time through static linkages.

Coding Python from the command line isn't a fun experience when you begin getting into longer form code. The command line simply isn't designed for that. That's where iPython comes in. At the end of this course, you'll have  a thorough understanding of iPython. I'm guessing it will even become your goto Python editor. You'll also know the differences between iPython and Jupyter. Through a number of examples with various scenarios, you'll develop an understanding of how iPython is an extremely efficient Python editor for long form code compared to the command line. You'll know how to enter in code, markdown for comments and rearrange/edit code as needed.

This session was recorded live at Data Modeling Zone 2016. Daniel D. Gutierrez is the speaker.
Data science involves understanding and preparing the data, defining the statistical learning model, and following the Data Science Process. Statistical learning models can assume many shapes and sizes, depending on their complexity and the application for which they are designed. The first step is to understand what questions you are trying to answer for your organization. The level of detail and complexity of your questions will increase as you be-come more comfortable with the data science process. 
In this session, Daniel covers the most important steps in the data science process – a general formula followed by data scientists in striving to achieve best practices with a data science project: understanding the goal of the project, data access, data munging, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model selection, model validation, data visualization, communicate the results and deploy the solution to production.

To the neophyte the world of technology seems bewildering. But – taken a step at a time – each part of the world of technology actually makes sense. The trick is to address technology a single step at a time. This course contains descriptions of all of the basics that a person not familiar with technology should know. This course is a good starting point for the person unfamiliar with technology. These segments are part of this video:
Indirect Access . This segment covers indirect access of data including the differences between searching for data and analyzing data. In explaining data analysis, we dive into textual analysis including patterns, classes of data, proximity of data, and summarizations. We discuss the benefits and challenges of searching versus analyzing text. We discuss the value of external categories.
DSS Environment. This segment covers the Decision Support Services (DSS) environment including a detailed explanation of the Corporate Information Factory (CIF). The different components of the CIF are defined including data marts, DSS applications, and the data warehouse. The importance of having a single source to which all data can be traced is emphasized. Different types of data marts are explored, including multi-dimensional Online Analytical Processing (OLAP), which is often called “cube” technology. Both drill down and drill up processing is explained with examples. This segment ends with a description of star joins.
Enterprise Resource Planning. This segment covers Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and the major players in this space including SAP. The drivers for implementing an ERP system are explained, as well as the pros and cons of buying versus building (buy vs. build).
 Architecture Factors . This segment covers the factors that shape architecture, including capability, cost, efficiency, and demand.
Historical Perspective. This segment explains how we arrived at our current system state, in areas such as applications, databases, extract programs, personal computers, spreadsheets, data warehousing, and analytics. Difference data warehouse environments are explored including federated (sometimes called a “virtual data warehouse”) and the spider web environment.
 Methodology. This segment covers the steps needed when building a data warehouse including starting with the data model, then designing the data warehouse, mapping to the legacy systems including order of development, and finally populating the data. Different development approaches are covered including the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) and agile/spiral approaches.
Parallel Processing. This segment covers parallel processing. There are many different ways to configure a computer to improve performance. What happens when either the workload or the volume of data grows? We talk about different solutions including increasing processor size and then introduce parallel processing. We discuss different ways that data can be spread across different processors.
Path Queue. This segment covers path queue for both structured and unstructured data. Textual extract, transform, and load (Textual ETL) is also discussed.
Structured Processing. We explain structured processing in this segment, including different approaches taken over time. We discuss structured programming including data flow diagrams and CRUD matrices, structured analysis, and standardized methodology such as the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC).
Data Warehouse Monitor. This segment explains the data warehouse monitor. The monitor keeps track of data usage and identifies which data is dormant.
Transaction Processing. This video will explain transaction processing. We explore every step from when a user enters data via the keyboard to when the database returns data to the application for display back to the user.
Patterns of Access. This segment covers the different ways data can be organized on disk. We explore hashing algorithms and sequential approaches. We talk about the different patterns of access by users such as online and random.
Back Up and Recovery. This segment covers backup and recovery. We talk about the importance of backup, including legal and regulatory requirements. We cover change data capture and inexpensive backup options including log tapes.
Batch and Online. This segment explains both batch and online transactions. We talk about the versatility of a transaction, and the importance of a reader.

Tuning. This  segment explains the importance of tuning as well as tuning approaches such as reconfiguration and reprioritization.
Storage. This segment explores storage along with its many variations, including historical storage. Learn about paper tape, punched cards, magnetic tape, and disk storage. Learn about the different parts of storage including keys, records, tracks, sectors, oxide, and disk.
System Components. This segment explains each computer component including processor, main memory, keyboard, disk storage, communications manager, applications, Database Management System (DBMS), Operating System (OS), internal wiring, and the monitor.
Standard Key Structure. This segment covers the various types of keys that can exist in our systems, and the pros and cons of each. We explore surrogate (or blind) keys as well as business keys. We discuss key conversion, including hashing algorithms.
Performance. This segment explores system performance. In the past, good performance was nice to have. Today good performance is mandatory. Many data warehouses today are mission critical and require quick response times. We discuss the factors impacting performance including data volumes, number of users, complexity of queries, and changing queries over time. We explain the Service Level Agreement (SLA) along with its importance.
Using Analysis Tools. This segment explains which analytical tools to use for different parts of the software development process including for requirements gathering, functional decomposition, Gantt charts, data flow diagrams, and HIPO.
Volumes of Data. This segment explores the challenges faced with large volumes of data. Learn how long data should exist within your environment, and plan to remove it after this time. We explain that data in a data warehouse can exist for very long periods of time, sometimes as long as ten years. We explore the issues on storage costs, performance, and administrative costs associated with storing large volumes of data. We discuss alternate forms of storage.
