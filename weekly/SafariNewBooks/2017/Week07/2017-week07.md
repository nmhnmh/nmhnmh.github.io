The proliferation of Web-based technologies during the last decade may have given the impression of wide-spread changes in educational practices. In fact, we have only begun to scratch the surface of experiencing the vast impact these technologies could have on education. Viewed separately, Web-based technologies offer exciting possibilities for expanding the capacity to provide access to instruction and knowledge world-wide. However, and perhaps more importantly, viewing these technological advancements in a more dynamic context, forces educators and researchers to rethink the fundamental processes of teaching and learning . It's not just a simple matter of using a technical tool to supply time and place ubiquity but to accept the challenge of understanding the implications for the entire educational spectrum. Web-based teaching and learning begs the question of what exactly these technologies means for learners, teachers, program designers, academic experts, technical and administrative staff, institutional decision makers, training managers, publishers, and others. Although a considerable amount of exploration has been conducted regarding web-based learning technologies, the breadth and scope for dialogue and experimentation needs to be broadened. International Journal of Web-Based Learning and Teaching Technologies (IJWLTT) provides a place for the dialogue and support of a diverse community interested in taking the challenge further.This issue contains the following articles:A Framework for Collaborative and Convenient Learning on Cloud Computing PlatformsImpact of ICT Usage in Primary-School Students' Learning in The Case of ThailandE-Learning System of Asia Through Open Courseware (OCW) and Educational Resources (OER) for Universal Access to Knowledge and InformationUnderstanding the Dimensions of Virtual Teams: A Study of Professional Students in India

Overview

In Test- Driven Development for React/Redux in an Isomorphic Application LiveLessons, Hany Elemary, Lead Consultant at ThoughtWorks, explains a paradigm shift in the testability of front-end code made possible with React/Redux. The video introduces isomorphic applications and their unique benefits and challenges, and then jumps straight into the architecture of React/Redux applications from a testability perspective. Hany follows test-driven development (TDD) principles while building a real-world example--a search application--to demonstrate effective end-to-end testing. Popular testing tools for React/Redux applications, including Enzyme, SinonJS, Expect, Nock and Mountebank, are highlighted.

Description

The need for building highly performant and maintainable user interfaces is now greater than ever. React, a library designed and developed by Facebook, can solve many of the existing problems users face today--including poor browser performance while handling dynamic interactions with high loads of data. React also solves a lot of challenges for front-end developers. Due to its popularity, other supporting frameworks, such as Redux, came into the picture to make applications more predictable, testable, and easier to debug. However, they come with a different approach to front-end development and testing.

Testability is key to maintaining the quality of any application while building confidence in the code as developers refactor their work. Writing proper tests can be a lengthy process, especially for newer frameworks such as React/Redux. Test-Driven Development for React/Redux in an Isomorphic Application LiveLessons quickly gets you up-to-speed on when to build isomorphic applications, how to effectively test your React and Redux code, and how to confidently refactor code while ensuring that business functionality is maintained.

We make inaccessible and unusable websites and apps all the time, but it’s not for lack of skill or talent. It’s just a case of doing things the wrong way. We try to build the best experiences we can, but we only make them for ourselves and for people like us.This book looks at common interface patterns from the perspective of an inclusive designer — someone trained in building experiences that cater to the huge diversity of abilities, preferences and circumstances out there.There’s no such thing as an ‘average’ user, but there is such a thing as an average developer. This book will take you from average to expert in the area that matters the most: making things more readable and more usable to more people.Ensuing chapters will look into discrete interface patterns; modules, components, widgets, conventions, whatever-you-want-to-call-thems. It would be foolhardy not to first acknowledge that each will ultimately belong to a web document. HTML pages vary dramatically in shape and size and can include any combination of patterns, but there are a handful of ‘document level’ best practices to which we should adhere.The aim here is not to go in search of the ultimate 'boilerplate' but to configure a parent web page to support inclusive design.You'll learn:Accessibility myths and misconceptions as well as common solutions and rules of thumbs,A library of well-tested accessible HTML/CSS components that you can use right away,How to properly use WAI-ARIA roles and Content Accessibility Guidelines,How to tackle common accessibility issues in RWD,How to deal with "skip" links and external links, as well as navigation regions and landmarks,How to keep labels, buttons, tables of contents, dynamic widgets and tabbed interfaces accessible,How to implement infinite scrolling, grid display and dynamic content accessibly,How to deal with password validation, error messages, web forms, JavaScript patterns and touch targets,How to keep an interface accessible in legacy browsers,How to prototype with accessibility in mind.

Step through the process of identifying and combining the right measures to gauge, narrate, and guide your organization's progress toward true success. All organizations have a common goal to be successful. All leaders want to make data-informed decisions and use measures to improve processes, communicate progress, and gain support. The problem is that proxy or partial measures don’t measure overall success and can be misleading. They measure performance parameters, progress on a specific task, customer feedback, and other piecemeal indices—which taken separately fail to describe an organization’s progress toward overall success.To measure success, leaders today are missing a key meta-analytic in their toolbox. In this book, metrics consultant Martin Klubeck provides it to them.Success Metricsshows organizational leaders how to measure success at the individual and organizational levels. By measuring success in multiple dimensions using multivariate methods you will be able to determine what works and what doesn’t. The key is to measure and promote progress in terms of organizational vision, mission, and overarching goals.Business leaders too often succumb to the working assumption that they only have to show shareholders and boards of trustees that they are turning a profit—the higher the profit, the more successful their stewardship of the company. Wrong! To truly thrive and endure, all organizations— corporate, government, small, large, nonprofit, or startup— need to define and pursue the underlying purpose for their existence.The author's integrated measures of success can be used to communicate organizational progress to stakeholders, shareholders, boards of trustees, corporate leaders, the workforce, and the customer base and thereby galvanize broad commitment to organizational success. Klubeck shows how his principles and methods of measuring overall success can be applied at all levels: individual, team, group, department, division, and organization.

Learn how to access analytics from SAS Cloud Analytic Services (CAS) using Python and the SAS&#174; Viya platform.
SAS&#174; Viya: The Python Perspective is an introduction to using the Python client on the SAS Viya platform. SAS Viya is a high-performance, fault-tolerant analytics architecture that can be deployed on both public and private cloud infrastructures. While SAS Viya can be used by various SAS applications, it also enables you to access analytic methods from SAS, Python, Lua, and Java, as well as through a REST interface using HTTP or HTTPS. This book focuses on the perspective of SAS Viya from Python. 
SAS Viya is made up of multiple components. The central piece of this ecosystem is SAS Cloud Analytic Services (CAS). CAS is the cloud-based server that all clients communicate with to run analytical methods. The Python client is used to drive the CAS component directly using objects and constructs that are familiar to Python programmers.
Some knowledge of Python would be helpful before using this book; however, there is an appendix that covers the features of Python that are used in the CAS Python client. Knowledge of CAS is not required to use this book. However, you will need to have a CAS server set up and running to execute the examples in this book. 
With this book, you will learn how to:
Install the required components for accessing CAS from Python
Connect to CAS, load data, and run simple analyses
Work with CAS using APIs familiar to Python users
Learn about general CAS workflows and advanced features of the CAS Python client 
SAS&#174; Viya: The Python Perspective covers topics that will be useful to beginners as well as experienced CAS users. It includes examples from creating connections to CAS all the way to simple statistics and machine learning, but it is also useful as a desktop reference.

An increasing amount of research is being done in the area where technology and humans meet. The success or failure of technologies, the question whether technology helps humans to fulfill their goals or whether it hinders them is in most cases not a technical one. Even though this problem has been recognized in many academic disciplines that deal with technology, we are still far from being able to present a set of theories that would allow us to understand the interaction of technology and humans and to put it to practical use. The International Journal of Technology and Human Interaction (IJTHI) aims to provide a platform for leading research that addresses issues of human and technology interaction. IJTHI seeks original contributions concerning any aspect of technology and human interaction dealing with the development, usage, failure, success, policies, strategies, and applications of them.

The cascading effects of globalization in the form of changing business environment, economic uncertainties and economic meltdown have brought about a plethora of unprecedented challenges for industry and organizations across the globe in recent years. Management education, which prepares human capital for industry, is expected to address these challenges along with others such as intensifying competition, advancing technology, increasing workforce diversity and accelerating complexity. Yet, current management education is largely based on traditional capitalism where the focus tends toward profits and competitiveness rather than toward a balance among profitability, responsibility, social accountability and sustainability. Consequently, management education in general, and MBA education in particular, need to adopt a paradigm shift in order to be more responsible and sustainable. The book contains contributions on the core management topics covered in general management, organizational behavior, ethics and social responsibility, with a focus on responsible management. Its chapters come from many authors in PRME schools from eight countries. Hence, it is expected to be useful to all the B-schools, across geographies that are interested in embedding responsibility in their management curriculum and teaching methodology.

Recording Studio Design, Fourth Edition explains the key principles of successful studio design and construction using straightforward language and the use of practical examples appreciated by readers of previous editions. Updated to reflect new industry standards, this fourth edition addresses improvements in cinema sound, with specific attention paid to B-chain electroacoustic response and calibration.Using over 50 years’ experience, author Philip Newell provides detail on the practical aspects of recording in various environments, not only exploring the complex issues relating to the acoustics but also providing real-world solutions. While the book contains detailed discussions about performing rooms, control rooms, and mobile studios, concepts of the infrastructures are also discussed, because no studio can perform optimally unless the technical and human requirements are adequately provided for. In this new edition, sound for cinema provides a platform for highlighting many, wider electroacoustic topics in a way that is relatively easy to visualise. The way in which sound and vision interact is an important aspect of many modern multimedia formats.The new edition includes:
A new Chapter 22 that will thoroughly reflect recently published SMPTE investigations which will drastically impact standards for cinema sound;
The inclusion of new academic research and its practical applications;
An entire new illustrated chapter on room construction principles; and
The consolidation of ideas which were only emerging when the earlier editions were published.

A contrarian challenge to the status quo, this book vigorously champi&#173;ons healthy skepticism in management theory and practice. Several com&#173;mon management maxims &#8212; often taken for granted as truisms &#8212; are examined and debunked with evidence-based arguments. The constant repetition of these flawed tropes perpetuates their mythological status and limits personal and organizational performance. Eleven management maxims are rebuked using empirical data, original scholarship, literature reviews, field observations, and thoughtful opinions from numerous ex&#173;perts. Far from a business as usual business book, Deconstructing Manage&#173;ment Maxims has been researched with academic rigor yet written in an approachable style. Unafraid of taking on conventional business wisdom, it contains some controversial yet substantiated positions that will pro&#173;voke critical thinking and debate. After all, sacred cows and long-believed tenets of management lore do not go away quietly. A clear message from this book is that you don&#8217;t have to believe everything you read or hear&#8212;be it in the classroom or at work! It offers a refreshing break from the constant drumbeat of dronish corporate and academic clich&#233;s. This book is best appreciated by readers wanting to think critically about important management phenomena.

The primary objective of the International Journal of Decision Support System Technology (IJDSST) is to provide comprehensive coverage for DMSS technology issues. The issues can involve, among other things, new hardware and software for DMSS, new models to deliver decision making support, dialog management between the user and system, data and model base management within the system, output display and presentation, DMSS operations, and DMSS technology management. Since the technology's purpose is to improve decision making, the articles are expected to link DMSS technology to improvements in the process and outcomes of the decision making process. Decision Making Support Systems (DMSS) are information systems that interactively support the decision making process of individuals and groups in life, public, and private organizations, and other entities. These systems include Decision Support Systems (DSS), Executive Information Systems (EIS), Executive Support systems (ESS), Management Support Systems (MSS), Knowledge Based Systems (KBS), Intelligent Decision Support Systems (IDSS) and Creativity Enhancing Systems (CES). A theme that all articles published in the IJDSST have in common is to define new technologies in support of decision making. These technologies can be developed from several points of view: methodological, theoretical or technical. Each DMSS is a vehicle that delivers effectively and efficiently information technology and decision technology to the system user at a local or networked workstation or online through the Internet. The areas addressed by published papers can be diverse, including but not limited to:architectures of DSS, functionalities, mathematical models ofproblem solving, algorithms, man-machine interface, methods or methodologies. Decision technology usually involves accounting, cognitive science, economic science, management science, statistical models, operational research models and multi-criteria analyses that describe the decision problem explicitly and provide algorithms and methodologies that generate recommended solutions. There are a number of excellent theoretical and applied scholarly journals that offer articles in many DMSS areas. None, however, have a primary focus on DMSS technology and its role in DMSS support for the decision making process. The IJDSST is the official journal publication of the Euro Working Group on Decision Support System (EWG-DSS) (https://ewgdss.wordpress.com/). Several special issues have been published from research conducted in this working group.This issue contains the following articles:A Comparative Study Based on Rough Set and Classification Via Clustering Approaches to Handle Incomplete Data to Predict Learning StylesLearning and Education Experience in System Dynamics of Management Students: Case StudiesKPI-Based Decision Evaluation System to Enhance QMSs for Higher Educational InstitutesDecision-Making Support Systems in Quality Management of Higher Education Institutions: A Selective Review
