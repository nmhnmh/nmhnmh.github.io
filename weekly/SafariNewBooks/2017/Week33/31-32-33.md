Analyze your data with ease and efficiency and modify applications that perform Data AnalysisAbout This VideoThis comprehensive video tutorial ensures you get your basics on point to perform data analysis with JavaGet to know the statistical data analysis techniques and implement them using the popular Java APIs and librariesLearn to work with relational, NoSQL, and time-series dataIn DetailData analysis is a process for inspecting, consolidating, transforming, and making sense of data in a way that guides the decision-making process. Effective data analysis is about transferring data through three main states: data, information, and knowledge. This matters because people become overwhelmed by large amounts of data, and make much better decisions on information at hand. Data analysis helps convert data into information, whether the consumer of this information is a person or machine-learning algorithm.This video course starts by showing you the various techniques of pre-processing your data. You will then get well-versed with the basics of data analysis with Java, how data changes state, and how Java fits into the analysis. You will then learn to apply the basic analysis to your business needs and create time-series predictions. Finally, you will see how to implement statistical data analysis techniques using Java APIs. You will also use JDBC to connect Java to SQL and MySQL databases. At the end of the video course, you will also see how to work with NoSQL databases.

In this video, Doug Barth and Evan Gilman describe what a zero trust network is, and why it is the natural evolution from the current best practice security models. Current network infrastructures are designed to protect your internal network with a firewall, and everything behind that firewall being "trusted" by default. zero trust networks are based on the philosophy that no network is trusted, be it external or internal. In this video, Doug and Evan discuss topics such as why it is important to move to a zero trust network model, what is driving the need to evolve security models, and what some of the benefits are for this type of network security model.Doug Barth is a software engineer who loves to learn and share his knowledge with others. He has worked on systems of various sizes at companies like Orbitz and PagerDuty. He has built and spoken about monitoring systems, mesh networks, and failure injection practices. Evan Gilman is an Operations Engineer with a background in computer networks.

Moving into the cloud and away from server-side takes away certain customization capabilities, but enhances the client-side look and feel. Relying on the SPFx framework, this new model can be used to create modern lightweight web applications in SharePoint Online. In the third volume, we will cover the newly emerging community-driven SharePoint Framework, short for SPFx. It is viewed as an expansion of existing Add-in model, focusing on delivering custom client-side web parts and page layouts, with more functionality in the roadmap. We will cover another emerging community driven client side development model that uses open source tools and does not require add-in packaging.We will cover the basic open-source toolchain and development workflow using this model. Later, we’ll develop a client side web part, as well as cover debugging, deployment and versioning of our solutions.In the end, we will list a number of active community resources, which are being constantly worked by a joint team of Microsoft internal representatives as well as SharePoint community’s most active MVPs.

An introduction to electronics to help you make the most from your Arduino or other prototyping platformAbout This VideoLearn more about electrical concepts and diodesCalculate voltage, current and resistanceMake use of resistors, capacitors and transistorIn DetailAre you an Arduino maker, able to make things by following how-to guides and are confident with writing or modifying sketches, yet you are not so confident about things like calculating transistor currents, voltage drops and using capacitors as filters?You are not alone. I have been teaching Arduino and Raspberry Pi topics for years. During this time I have realized that while these platforms are great for helping you to start tinkering with electronics, you will not be able to truly enjoy their power until you have understood basic electronics.This is what this course is about. It is about helping you achieve a better level of understanding of the basic electronics principles and components that are commonly used in making on platforms like the Arduino and the Raspberry Pi. I have designed this course for anyone with a basic understanding of electronics, who has already spent time tinkering with Arduinos. By the end of this course, you will have learned how to use commonly used components found in Arduino projects. You will also have learned how to do the relevant measurements and calculations to help you select appropriate components for your projects.To complete this course, you will need a few cheap and common components and tools: resistors, capacitors, transistors, LED, diodes, and batteries. You will also need a multimeter, a small breadboard and jumper wires. All of these are probably things that you already have.

It's not uncommon these days to see people complaining about just how complex JavaScript development seems to have become. We can have some sympathy with that view when it's coming from someone new to the language. If you're learning JS, it won't take long for you to be exposed to the enormity of the ecosystem and the sheer number of moving pieces you need to understand (at least conceptually) to build a modern web application. Package management, linting, transpilation, module bundling, minification, source maps, frameworks, unit testing, hot reloading... it can't be denied that this is a lot more complex that just including a couple of script tags in your page and FTPing it up to the server.Included topics:The Anatomy of a Modern JavaScript Application by James KolceAn Introduction to Gulp.js by Craig BucklerThe Basics of DOM Manipulation in Vanilla JavaScript (No jQuery) by Sebastian SeitzA Beginner's Guide to Webpack 2 and Module Bundling by Mark BrownReact vs Angular: An In-depth Comparison by Pavels JelisejevsRetrofit Your Website as a Progressive Web App by Craig Buckler10 Tips to Become a Better Node Developer by Azat MardanAn Introduction to Functional JavaScript by M.

PHP powers the vast majority of the web today. It is by far the most ubiquitous and accessible mature web language, and welcomes thousands of new developers every day. It is this ease of access that can, admittedly, sometimes give it a bad name - good resources are few and far in between, and the competition is real, driving people to take shortcuts, skip best practices, and learn on-the-fly.With PHP 7+ came some improvements that make it harder to make mistakes, and 7.2 is making things even safer, even more structured. If you're just getting started with the language (or perhaps youve been using it a while and have learned some bad habits), you're in luck.

We’ll look at animated visualizations that’ll help explain difficult concepts such as higher-order functions, lenses and persistent data, partial application, currying, ES6, asynchronous code with promises and ES2017 async-await.While we anchor these techniques into your mind with the practical usage, you will also learn about techniques to write maintainable software, test-driven development, top-down design, and bottom-up design. Finally, we will use Mocha and Chai to write unit tests for the functional part of the applications.Prerequisites:  Basic knowledge of JavaScriptResources: Code downloads and errata:Learn to Write Functional JavascriptImplementing and Testing Applications using Functional JavaScriptPATH PRODUCTSThis path navigates across the following products (in sequential order):Learn to Write Functional Javascript (3h 48m)Implementing and Testing Applications using Functional JavaScript  (2h 36m)

Lesson Descriptions

Lesson 1: Product Owner Overview
Lesson 1 provides an overview of the activities a product owner performs and the skills and attributes commonly found in a good product owner. It also covers how roles in an existing organization might be compatible (and not so compatible) with the role of product owners.

Lesson 2: Managing the Product Backlog
This is one of the more critical parts of the job of product owner The lesson starts at the beginning with capturing the user’s voice and how you can then take that and create a product backlog. Next, the lesson tackles how you can mature you backlog items, estimate them with your team, prioritize them for maximum value, and then from that create a release plan. Finally, the lesson addresses how you can make the product backlog visible to the entire organization to foster clear communication.

Lesson 3: Creating the Product Increment
Now that you have a solid product backlog in place, it is time to discuss how to begin and execute a sprint in order to deliver some small increment of your eventual product. As you are doing that, you want to also learn good practices around keeping your product backlog fresh by continually refining it during the sprint.

Lesson 4: Incorporating Feedback
After you are done with your sprint, you need to cover the activities around ending it. Plus, you now have your product out there in the wild, and you will want to maximize your learning by incorporating feedback from your customers.

Lesson 5: Product Owner Patterns and Anti-Patterns
So far you’ve learned the product owner role as it was meant to be implemented, but you know the real world often has other plans. In this lesson, we cover a few common situations I’ve experienced as a product owner that stray from the prescribed path. You learn how to try to work within these scenarios and how you might move past them.

Lesson 6: Product Owner Certifications
I am constantly asked by people wanting to become product owners if they should pay to get certified, and if so, which certification should they get. In this lesson, you learn about the practical reasons surrounding getting certified as a product owner and your options.

This book offers an overview of some recent advances in the Computational Bioacoustics methods and technology. In the focus of discussion is the pursuit of scalability, which would facilitate real-world applications of different scope and purpose, such as wildlife monitoring, biodiversity assessment, pest population control, and monitoring the spread of disease transmitting mosquitoes. The various tasks of Computational Bioacoustics are described and a wide range of audio parameterization and recognition tasks related to the automated recognition of species and sound events is discussed. Many of the Computational Bioacoustics methods were originally developed for the needs of speech, audio, or image processing, and afterwards were adapted to the requirements of automated acoustic recognition of species, or were elaborated further to address the challenges of real-world operation in 24/7 mode. The interested reader is encouraged to follow the numerous references and links to web resources for further information and insights. This book is addressed to Software Engineers, IT experts, Computer Science researchers, Bioacousticians, and other practitioners concerned with the creation of new tools and services, aimed at enhancing the technological support to Computational Bioacoustics applications. STTM, Speech Technology and Text Mining in Medicine and Health CareThis series demonstrates how the latest advances in speech technology and text mining positively affect patient healthcare and, in a much broader sense, public health at large. New developments in text mining methods have allowed health care providers to monitor a large population of patients at any time and from any location. Employing advanced summarization techniques, patient data can be readily extracted from extensive clinical documents in electronic health records and immediately made available to the physician. These same summarization techniques can also aid the healthcare provider in extracting from the large corpora of medical literature the relevant information for treating the patient. The series topics include the design and acceptance of speech-enabled robots that assist in the operating room, studies of signal processing and acoustic modeling for speech and communication disorders, advanced statistical speech enhancement methods for creating synthetic voice, and technologies for addressing speech and language impairments. Titles in the Series consist of both authored books and edited contributions. All authored books and contributed works are peer-reviewed.

A key aspect of robotics today is estimating the state, such as position and orientation, of a robot as it moves through the world. Most robots and autonomous vehicles depend on noisy data from sensors such as cameras or laser rangefinders to navigate in a three-dimensional world. This book presents common sensor models and practical advice on how to carry out state estimation for rotations and other state variables. It covers both classical state estimation methods such as the Kalman filter, as well as important modern topics such as batch estimation, the Bayes filter, sigmapoint and particle filters, robust estimation for outlier rejection, and continuous-time trajectory estimation and its connection to Gaussian-process regression. The methods are demonstrated in the context of important applications such as point-cloud alignment, pose-graph relaxation, bundle adjustment, and simultaneous localization and mapping. Students and practitioners of robotics alike will find this a valuable resource.

The proliferation of Web-based technologies during the last decade may have given the impression of wide-spread changes in educational practices. In fact, we have only begun to scratch the surface of experiencing the vast impact these technologies could have on education. Viewed separately, Web-based technologies offer exciting possibilities for expanding the capacity to provide access to instruction and knowledge world-wide. However, and perhaps more importantly, viewing these technological advancements in a more dynamic context, forces educators and researchers to rethink the fundamental processes of teaching and learning. It's not just a simple matter of using a technical tool to supply time and place ubiquity but to accept the challenge of understanding the implications for the entire educational spectrum. Web-based teaching and learning begs the question of what exactly these technologies means for learners, teachers, program designers, academic experts, technical and administrative staff, institutional decision makers, training managers, publishers, and others. Although a considerable amount of exploration has been conducted regarding web-based learning technologies, the breadth and scope for dialogue and experimentation needs to be broadened. The International Journal of Web-Based Learning and Teaching Technologies (IJWLTT) provides a place for the dialogue and support of a diverse community interested in taking the challenge further.This issue contains the following articles:Designing Stories for Educational Video Games: Analysis and EvaluationEnhancement Process of Didactic Strategies in a Degree Course for Pre-Service TeachersIncorporating a Quality and Innovation Culture in Daily TeachingMobile Technology to Support the Interactive ClassroomLearning in Cross-Media EnvironmentThe Appropriateness of Scratch and App Inventor as Educational Environments for Teaching Introductory Programming in Primary and Secondary EducationFeedback Conversations: Creating Feedback Dialogues with a New Textual Tool for Industrial Design Student Feedback
