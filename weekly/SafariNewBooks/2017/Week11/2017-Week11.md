However, putting them into practice when you have a big monolith application can be difficult. Microservices architecture offers one solution.Breaking the monolith and moving toward a microservices architecture can offer significant advantages to organizations, in terms of improving team autonomy and increasing frequency of change. These benefits, however, come at a cost. Teams are not always aware of the additional complexity associated with distributed systems and the level of maturity and investment that organizations require to succeed with them.In Moving to Microservices LiveLessons, María Gómez, a lead consultant at Thoughtworks, defines the prerequisites for moving into a microservices architecture. With step-by-step examples using domain-driven design (DDD) and other extreme programming (XP) techniques, she demonstrates how to break down your existing monolith into independent, cooperating entities. She helps you understand the relative cost of the changes involved so that you can decide whether they are worth it for your organization.About the InstructorMaría Gómezis a tech lead and lead consultant at ThoughtWorks.

Research Shows Organizations That Focus on Employee Experience Far Outperform Those That Don'tRecently a new type of organization has emerged, one that focuses on employee experiences as a way to drive innovation, increase customer satisfaction, find and hire the best people, make work more engaging, and improve overall performance. The Employee Experience Advantage is the first book of its kind to tackle this emerging topic that is becoming the #1 priority for business leaders around the world. Although everyone talks about employee experience nobody has really been able to explain concretely what it is and how to go about designing for it...until now.How can organizations truly create a place where employees want to show up to work versus need to show up to work? For decades the business world has focused on measuring employee engagement meanwhile global engagement scores remain at an all time low despite all the surveys and institutes that been springing up tackle this problem. Clearly something is not working. Employee engagement has become the short-term adrenaline shot that organizations turn to when they need to increase their engagement scores. Instead, we have to focus on designing employee experiences which is the long term organizational design that leads to engaged employees. This is the only long-term solution. Organizations have been stuck focusing on the cause instead of the effect. The cause is employee experience; the effect is an engaged workforce.Backed by an extensive research project that looked at over 150 studies and articles, featured extensive interviews with over 150 executives, and analyzed over 250 global organizations, this book clearly breaks down the three environments that make up every single employee experience at every organization around the world and how to design for them. These are the cultural, technological, and physical environments. This book explores the attributes that organizations need to focus on in each one of these environments to create COOL spaces, ACE technology, and a CELEBRATED culture. Featuring exclusive case studies, unique frameworks, and never before seen research, The Employee Experience Advantage guides readers on a journey of creating a place where people actually want to show up to work.Readers will learn:The trends shaping employee experienceHow to evaluate their own employee experience using the Employee Experience ScoreWhat the world's leading organizations are doing around employee experienceHow to design for technology, culture, and physical spacesThe role people analytics place in employee experienceFrameworks for how to actually create employee experiencesThe role of the gig economyThe future of employee experienceNine types of organizations that focus on employee experienceAnd much more!There is no question that engaged employees perform better, aspire higher, and achieve more, but you can't create employee engagement without designing employee experiences first. It's time to rethink your strategy and implement a real-world framework that focuses on how to create an organization where people want to show up to work. The Employee Experience Advantage shows you how to do just that.

  Description
  
  Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) processes have become a necessity in IT today. Being able to move data from one place to another has become a cornerstone in just about every company worldwide. SQL Server 2016 provides Integration Services (SSIS) that allow database administrators (DBAs) and developers alike to create and deploy advanced ETL packages to leverage the data within their organizations.
  
  Whether a company has a one-time data copy or a large ETL process to design, they want to be able to complete their work as easily as possible. With SSIS now being included with the SQL Server platform, it is one of the easiest and most cost-effective methods available to a shop running SQL Server.
  
  IT shops can have hundreds of software developers, all running and developing applications for SQL Server. In addition, hundreds of third-party applications use SQL Server for storage. All this data, sooner or later, will require that companies be able to consolidate and analyze it. Familiarity with an ETL tool will become an absolute necessity when data needs to be moved for consolidation, reporting, and data mining.
  
Introduction to SQL Server 2016 Integration Services (SSIS) LiveLessons covers the basic building blocks of SSIS. Topics include design best practices, control flows, data flows, and deployment and scheduling of packages.About the InstructorEric Johnson (MCSE, MCDBA, MCSD) is co-founder of Consortio Services, and the company’s primary Database Technologies Consultant.

SummaryReactive Design Patterns is a clearly written guide for
building message-driven distributed systems that are resilient,
responsive, and elastic. In this book you'll find patterns for
messaging, flow control, resource management, and concurrency,
along with practical issues like test-friendly designs. All
patterns include concrete examples using Scala and Akka.About the TechnologyModern web applications serve potentially vast numbers of
users—and they need to keep working as servers fail and new
ones come online, users overwhelm limited resources, and
information is distributed globally. A Reactive application adjusts
to partial failures and varying loads, remaining responsive in an
ever-changing distributed environment. The secret is message-driven
architecture—and design patterns to organize it.About the BookReactive Design Patterns presents the principles,
patterns, and best practices of Reactive application design.
You’ll learn how to keep one slow component from bogging down
others with the Circuit Breaker pattern, how to shepherd a
many-staged transaction to completion with the Saga pattern, how to
divide datasets by Sharding, and more. You’ll even see how to
keep your source code readable and the system testable despite many
potential interactions and points of failure.What’s InsideThe definitive guide to the Reactive ManifestoPatterns for flow control, delimited consistency, fault
tolerance, and much moreHard-won lessons about what doesn’t workArchitectures that scale under tremendous loadAbout the ReaderMost examples use Scala, Java, and Akka. Readers should be

Features an integrated approach of statistical scenarios and simulations to aid readers in developing key intuitions needed to understand the wide ranging concepts and methods of statistics and inferenceIlluminating Statistical Analysis Using Scenarios and Simulations presents the basic concepts of statistics and statistical inference using the dual mechanisms of scenarios and simulations. This approach helps readers develop key intuitions and deep understandings of statistical analysis. Scenario-specific sampling simulations depict the results that would be obtained by a very large number of individuals investigating the same scenario, each with their own evidence, while graphical depictions of the simulation results present clear and direct pathways to intuitive methods for statistical inference. These intuitive methods can then be easily linked to traditional formulaic methods, and the author does not simply explain the linkages, but rather provides demonstrations throughout for a broad range of statistical phenomena. In addition, induction and deduction are repeatedly interwoven, which fosters a natural "need to know basis" for ordering the topic coverage.Examining computer simulation results is central to the discussion and provides an illustrative way to (re)discover the properties of sample statistics, the role of chance, and to (re)invent corresponding principles of statistical inference. In addition, the simulation results foreshadow the various mathematical formulas that underlie statistical analysis.In addition, this book:• Features both an intuitive and analytical perspective and includes a broad introduction to the use of Monte Carlo simulation and formulaic methods for statistical analysis• Presents straight-forward coverage of the essentials of basic statistics and ensures proper understanding of key concepts such as sampling distributions, the effects of sample size and variance on uncertainty, analysis of proportion, mean and rank differences, covariance, correlation, and regression• Introduces advanced topics such as Bayesian statistics, data mining, model cross-validation, robust regression, and resampling• Contains numerous example problems in each chapter with detailed solutions as well as an appendix that serves as a manual for constructing simulations quickly and easily using Microsoft® Office Excel®Illuminating Statistical Analysis Using Scenarios and Simulations is an ideal textbook for courses, seminars, and workshops in statistics and statistical inference and is appropriate for self-study as well. The book also serves as a thought-provoking treatise for researchers, scientists, managers, technicians, and others with a keen interest in statistical analysis.Jeffrey E.

It's well known that identifying and fixing problems in design is easier and cheaper if it can be done earlier in the process of design and build. That's because as the fidelity of the project we're working on increases, the effort involved in making changes increases. If we can test out early ideas to see if they work, in small chunks, then we can identify whether those ideas are going to work. To do this, we need to build prototypes.With easy-to-follow, practical advice, this book will show you how to use a number of different prototyping techniques to improve UX.

Author Patty Azzarello draws on over twenty-five years of international business management experience to identify the chronic challenges that keep organizations from decisively executing strategy, and to give you a practical game plan for breaking through. Leaders tend to assume that stalls in execution are inevitable, unchanging parts of the workplace—but things can change. At the heart of every execution problem is the fact that there simply are not enough people doing what the business needs. This guide shows you how to get your entire organization on board—remove the fear, excuses, and hurdles—and uphold the new pursuit against distractions and dissent. No transformation can succeed without suitable engagement from the whole organization, but building engagement can be difficult, uncomfortable, and tentative. This book shows you how to get it done. Get your organization to embrace and personally commit to the new workRemove obstacles and passive aggressive attacks that block progressDefend new strategic initiatives against short term pressures to revert to "business as usual"Sustain momentum and the desire to move forwardMake sure no one is ever asking, 'Are we still doing this?'Inertia isn't just a law of the universe, it's a law in the workplace that can be a major obstacle to making things happen. The great thing about inertia is that it cuts two ways: a body at rest remains at rest, but a body in motion remains in motion. People love to finish things. Move shows you how to make successful execution the new norm—starting today.

Tap into everyday courage for extraordinary resultsThe Courageous Leader presents a much-needed reminder for leaders everywhere: it takes courage.

The New Psychology of SellingThe sales profession is in the midst of a perfect storm. Buyers have more power—more information, more at stake, and more control over the sales process—than any time in history. Technology is bringing disruptive change at an ever-increasing pace, creating fear and uncertainty that leaves buyers clinging to the status quo. Deteriorating attention spans have made it difficult to get buyers to sit still long enough to “challenge,” “teach,” “help,” give “insight,” or sell “value.” And a relentless onslaught of “me-too” competitors have made differentiating on the attributes of products, services, or even price more difficult than ever.Legions of salespeople and their leaders are coming face to face with a cold hard truth: what once gave salespeople a competitive edge—controlling the sales process, command of product knowledge, an arsenal of technology, and a great pitch—are no longer guarantees of success. Yet this is where the vast majority of the roughly $20 billion spent each year on sales training goes.  It’s no wonder many companies are seeing 50 percent or more of their salespeople miss quota.  Yet, in this new paradigm, an elite group of top 1 percent sales professionals are crushing it. In our age of technology where information is ubiquitous and buyer attention spans are fleeting, these superstars have learned how to leverage a new psychology of selling—Sales EQ—to keep prospects engaged, create true competitive differentiation, as well as shape and influence buying decisions. These top earners are acutely aware that the experience of buying from them is far more important than products, prices, features, and solutions.In Sales EQ, Jeb Blount takes you on an unprecedented journey into the behaviors, techniques, and secrets of the highest earning salespeople in every industry and field. You’ll learn:How to answer the 5 Most Important Questions in Sales to make it virtually impossible for prospects to say noHow to master 7 People Principles that will give you the power to influence anyone to do almost anythingHow to shape and align the 3 Processes of Sales to lock out competitors and shorten the sales cycleHow to Flip the Buyer Script to gain complete control of the sales conversationHow to Disrupt Expectations to pull buyers towards you, direct their attention, and keep them engagedHow to leverage Non-Complementary Behavior to eliminate resistance, conflict, and objectionsHow to employ the Bridge Technique to gain the micro-commitments and next steps you need to keep your deals from stallingHow to tame Irrational Buyers, shake them out of their comfort zone, and shape the decision making processHow to measure and increase you own Sales EQ using the 15 Sales Specific Emotional Intelligence MarkersAnd so much more!  Sales EQ begins where The Challenger Sale, Strategic Selling, and Spin Selling leave off. It addresses the human relationship gap in the modern sales process at a time when sales organizations are failing because many salespeople have never been taught the human skills required to effectively engage buyers at the emotional level.  Jeb Blount makes a compelling case that sales specific emotional intelligence (Sales EQ) is more essential to success than education, experience, industry awareness, product knowledge, skills, or raw IQ; and, sales professionals who invest in developing and improving Sales EQ gain a decisive competitive advantage in the hyper-competitive global marketplace.Sales EQ arms salespeople and sales leaders with the tool

Start-to-finish guidance toward building and implementing a robust DC planSuccessful Defined Contribution Investment Design offers a comprehensive guidebook for fiduciaries tasked with structuring and implementing a 401(k) or other defined contribution (DC) pension plan. More than a collection of the usual piecemeal information, this book seeks to offer a complete, contemporary framework for plan design, together with tested methodologies and analytic techniques to help streamline plan monitoring, management and improve participant outcomes. Examples from plan sponsors provide on-the-ground insight while suggestions from DC consultants add expert perspective. Views from ERISA expert counsel provide additional understanding—along with input from academic thought leaders. Finally, investment evaluation and analysis is joined with participant savings and asset allocation data to look prospectively at potential outcomes, and case studies illustrate real-world implementation of objective-aligned asset allocation such as custom target-date strategies. Though the focus is primarily on U.S. plan design, author perspectives from countries including Australia, the United Kingdom and Canada provide relevant and helpful viewpoints for both new and experienced plan fiduciaries. For the vast majority of workers, DC plans have replaced traditional defined benefit pension plans as the primary source of employer-provided retirement income.

A definitive guide to cybersecurity lawExpanding on the author’s experience as a cybersecurity lawyer and law professor, Cybersecurity Law is the definitive guide to cybersecurity law, with an in-depth analysis of U.S. and international laws that apply to data security, data breaches, sensitive information safeguarding, law enforcement surveillance, cybercriminal combat, privacy, and many other cybersecurity issues. Written in an accessible manner, the book provides real-world examples and case studies to help readers understand the practical applications of the presented material. The book begins by outlining the legal requirements for data security, which synthesizes the Federal Trade Commission’s cybersecurity cases in order to provide the background of the FTC’s views on data security. The book also examines data security requirements imposed by a growing number of state legislatures and private litigation arising from data breaches. Anti-hacking laws, such as the federal Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, Economic Espionage Act, and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, and how companies are able to fight cybercriminals while ensuring compliance with the U.S. Constitution and statutes are discussed thoroughly. Featuring an overview of the laws that allow coordination between the public and private sectors as well as the tools that regulators have developed to allow a limited amount of collaboration, this book also:• Addresses current U.S. and international laws, regulations, and court opinions that define the field of cybersecurity including the security of sensitive information, such as financial data and health information• Discusses the cybersecurity requirements of the largest U.S. trading partners in Europe, Asia, and Latin America, and specifically addresses how these requirements are similar to (and differ from) those in the U.S.• Provides a compilation of many of the most important cybersecurity statutes and regulations• Emphasizes the compliance obligations of companies with in-depth analysis of crucial U.S. and international laws that apply to cybersecurity issues• Examines government surveillance laws and privacy laws that affect cybersecurity as well as each of the data breach notification laws in 47 states and the District of Columbia• Includes numerous case studies and examples throughout to aid in classroom use and to help readers better understand the presented material• Supplemented with a companion website that features in-class discussion questions and timely and recent updates on recent legislative developments as well as information on interesting cases on relevant and significant topicsCybersecurity Law is appropriate as a textbook for undergraduate and graduate-level courses in cybersecurity, cybersecurity law, cyber operations, management-oriented information technology (IT), and computer science.

A comprehensive overview of data science covering the analytics, programming, and business skills necessary to master the disciplineFinding a good data scientist has been likened to hunting for a unicorn: the required combination of technical skills is simply very hard to find in one person. In addition, good data science is not just rote application of trainable skill sets; it requires the ability to think flexibly about all these areas and understand the connections between them. This book provides a crash course in data science, combining all the necessary skills into a unified discipline.Unlike many analytics books, computer science and software engineering are given extensive coverage since they play such a central role in the daily work of a data scientist. The author also describes classic machine learning algorithms, from their mathematical foundations to real-world applications. Visualization tools are reviewed, and their central importance in data science is highlighted. Classical statistics is addressed to help readers think critically about the interpretation of data and its common pitfalls. The clear communication of technical results, which is perhaps the most undertrained of data science skills, is given its own chapter, and all topics are explained in the context of solving real-world data problems. The book also features:• Extensive sample code and tutorials using Python™ along with its technical libraries• Core technologies of “Big Data,” including their strengths and limitations and how they can be used to solve real-world problems• Coverage of the practical realities of the tools, keeping theory to a minimum; however, when theory is presented, it is done in an intuitive way to encourage critical thinking and creativity• A wide variety of case studies from industry• Practical advice on the realities of being a data scientist today, including the overall workflow, where time is spent, the types of datasets worked on, and the skill sets neededThe Data Science Handbook is an ideal resource for data analysis methodology and big data software tools. The book is appropriate for people who want to practice data science, but lack the required skill sets. This includes software professionals who need to better understand analytics and statisticians who need to understand software.

Featuring a timely presentation of total survey error (TSE), this edited volume introduces valuable tools for understanding and improving survey data quality in the context of evolving large-scale data setsThis book provides an overview of the TSE framework and current TSE research as related to survey design, data collection, estimation, and analysis. It recognizes that survey data affects many public policy and business decisions and thus focuses on the framework for understanding and improving survey data quality. The book also addresses issues with data quality in official statistics and in social, opinion, and market research as these fields continue to evolve, leading to larger and messier data sets. This perspective challenges survey organizations to find ways to collect and process data more efficiently without sacrificing quality. The volume consists of the most up-to-date research and reporting from over 70 contributors representing the best academics and researchers from a range of fields. The chapters are broken out into five main sections: The Concept of TSE and the TSE Paradigm, Implications for Survey Design, Data Collection and Data Processing Applications, Evaluation and Improvement, and Estimation and Analysis. Each chapter introduces and examines multiple error sources, such as sampling error, measurement error, and nonresponse error, which often offer the greatest risks to data quality, while also encouraging readers not to lose sight of the less commonly studied error sources, such as coverage error, processing error, and specification error. The book also notes the relationships between errors and the ways in which efforts to reduce one type can increase another, resulting in an estimate with larger total error.This book:• Features various error sources, and the complex relationships between them, in 25 high-quality chapters on the most up-to-date research in the field of TSE• Provides comprehensive reviews of the literature on error sources as well as data collection approaches and estimation methods to reduce their effects• Presents examples of recent international events that demonstrate the effects of data error, the importance of survey data quality, and the real-world issues that arise from these errors• Spans the four pillars of the total survey error paradigm (design, data collection, evaluation and analysis) to address key data quality issues in official statistics and survey researchTotal Survey Error in Practice is a reference for survey researchers and data scientists in research areas that include social science, public opinion, public policy, and business.

Written by an internationally recognized expert in the field, this book explores the theory, research, and practice driving innovation in both adult learning and learning technology, and illuminates a powerful approach to recognize and leverage these opportunities. Building on current trends and research in technology and its use, each chapter illustrates the need, opportunities, and examples of current and future technologies that scaffold adult learning, and provides comprehensive coverage of both current and emerging challenges. Many adult learning faculty, practitioners, and students realize that technology presents a growing and ever-present set of issues, yet few feel confident in identifying the opportunities that arise with each step forward. This book clarifies the interplay between adult learning and learning technology, and characterizes the cyclic exchange of information and opportunities that link these fields now and in the future. Understand the critical issues currently affecting adult learningLearn how technology is presenting both opportunities and challenges for the teaching and learning of adults in different contextsExamine recent research on learning technology for adult learnersDiscover how technological innovation can be applied now and how it will continue to shape the future of learningAdult learning is on the rise, and there is no mistaking technology's role; whether they're learning with or about technology, today's adult learners come with unique sets of needs and skills that demand specialized approaches. Traditional pedagogical techniques don't transfer directly, and learning technology requires its own unique approach to development and use. Technology and Innovation in Adult Learning equips practitioners to further adult learning and shape the future of the field, while providing a rich perspective for classroom inquiry and research.

Building near real-time analytical applications that combine real-time data inserts, updates, and fast analytics is almost impossible with any single Hadoop storage technology. The introduction of Apache Kudu and the "KIKS" stack breaks through this barrier, making it possible to build near real-time analytical applications that are simple, fast, and reliable. In this course, designed for developers, architects, and engineers with some experience working with common Hadoop components (Kafka, Hive, Spark, Impala, etc.), you'll use "KIKS" to create an app that demonstrates the real-time ingestion, persistence, and visualization of time-series events.Kudu is at the center of this architecture. It combines real-time inserts, random lookups, and fast analytics into a single storage layer without the need for the complexities of the lambda architecture, making time-series and IOT use-cases much easier to conquer than with previous generation big data technologies. The app you'll build uses real-time financial data, but it also applies to use cases in IOT, retail, manufacturing, and other industries with real-time analytical needs.

Your CEO just came to you, the HR leader, and said she was hearing rumors about the turnover rate going up.  She asks you why this might be happening and how it is could be affecting the bottom line.  Are there certain leadership issues? Are engagement levels changing?  Is there a problem with the company culture?
These are all logical questions.  You have hunches for answers, but you have no way to prove those hunches.  You know your CEO is going to want data to support any argument you make. 
You are sure that the answers to her questions are buried in the employee data collected in the different HR systems you have.  You have been reading about "HR analytics", and you wonder how you would answer her question differently if you really understood the data about your people. Quantifiably Better provides a path to follow in search of these answers.  It will help you if you are just getting started with your HR analytics initiative, or if you are looking for ways to expand your existing HR analytics practice.

This book examines what would happen if we were to deploy blockchain technology at the sovereign level and use it to create a decentralized cashless economy. This book explains how finance and economics work today, and how the convergence of various technologies related to the financial sector can help us find solutions to problems, such as excessive debt creation, banks getting too big to fail, and shadow banking. The Blockchain Alternative offers sensible corrections to outdated and incorrect dogmas, such as the efficient markets hypothesis and rational expectations theory. You’ll also be introduced to universal basic income, the consequences of going cashless, why complexity economics needs to be understood and what kinds of tools and theories you'll need to redefine the existing definition of capitalism.While the book does discuss technologies and methods that are primed for our future, a number of references are made to economic history and the works of great thinkers from a different era. You’ll see how the blockchain can be used to deploy solutions that were devised in the past, but which can serve as the antidote to our current economic malaises. You'll discover that what is required today is not an adaptation of the old theories, but a new methodology that is suited to this new era. Without undertaking such an endeavor, one will always be burdened with a definition of capitalism that is out of kilter with the evolution of our digital humanity.What would this mean to monetary and fiscal policy, market structure and our current understanding of economics? More importantly would we need to change our current understanding of capitalism? And if we were to change our perceptions, what would the future version look like?  This book answers these questions, and analyses some of the most pertinent issues of our generation.

Learn how Roslyn's new code generation capability will let you write software that is more concise, runs faster, and is easier to maintain. You will learn from real-world business applications to create better software by letting the computer write its own code based on your business logic already defined in lookup tables. Code Generation with Rosyln is the first book to cover this new capability.  You will learn how these techniques can be used to simplify systems integration so that if one system already defines business logic through lookup tables, you can integrate a new system and share business logic by allowing the new system to write its own business logic based on already existing table-based business logic. One of the many benefits you will discover is that Roslyn uses an innovative approach to compiler design, opening up the inner workings of the compiler process. You will learn how to see the syntax tree that Roslyn is building as it compiles your code. Additionally, you will learn to feed it your own syntax tree that you create on the fly.
