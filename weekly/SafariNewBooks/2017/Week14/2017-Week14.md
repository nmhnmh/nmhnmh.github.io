Consistently Design PDNs That Deliver Reliable Performance at
the Right Cost
Too often, PDN designs work inconsistently, and techniques that
work in some scenarios seem to fail inexplicably in others. This
book explains why and presents realistic processes for getting PDN
designs right in any new product. Drawing on 60+ years of signal
and power integrity experience, Larry Smith and Eric Bogatin show
how to manage noise and electrical performance, and complement
intuition with analysis to balance cost, performance, risk, and
schedule. Throughout, they distill the essence of complex
real-world problems, quantify core principles via approximation,
and apply them to specific examples. For easy usage, dozens of key
concepts and observations are highlighted as tips and listed in
quick, chapter-ending summaries.

Coverage includes
• A practical, start-to-finish approach to consistently
meeting PDN performance goals
• Understanding how signals interact with interconnects
• Identifying root causes of common problems, so you can
avoid them
• Leveraging analysis tools to efficiently explore design
space and optimize tradeoffs
• Analyzing impedance-related properties of series and
parallel RLC circuits
• Measuring low impedance for components and entire PDN
ecologies
• Predicting loop inductance from physical design
features
• Reducing peak impedances from combinations of
capacitors
• Understanding power and ground plane properties in the PDN
interconnect
• Taming signal integrity problems when signals change return
planes
• Reducing peak impedance created by on-die capacitance and
package lead inductance
• Controlling transient current waveform interactions with
PDN features
• Simple spreadsheet-based analysis techniques for quickly
creating first-pass designs

This guide will be indispensable for all engineers involved in PDN
design, including product, board, and chip designers; system,
hardware, component, and package engineers; power supply designers,
SI and EMI engineers, sales engineers, and their
managers.

Create modern cutting-edge reactive applications with FluxAbout This VideoPart of the complete Full-Stack React courseThe thorough teaching style ensures content is understood This video teaches you a variety of modern web technologies, such as Flux, React, ES6, JSX, and moreIn DetailFlux is a web application development architecture created and used by Facebook. It fits seamlessly with React—in MVC terms, Flux is the Model and Controller to React’s View, but it actually goes much deeper than that. Flux is a new way of thinking compared to the old MVC model. Instead, it sets out a Dispatcher, Store, and View model for creating applications with much clearer data flow. Enabling you to create cleaner and more easily maintainable applications that scale better and are easier to debug. This course starts by having a running server that connects to Mongo database with Mongoose. We will also explore more about Nodemon, express, EJS, MongoDB, and Mongoose. Then we proceed to add React to present the data sent from the server. After integrating React into our workflow, the course focuses on building some of the critical components required to create the To-Do list. Then we proceed to learn about data storage and management on the client. Once you get acquainted with Flux and React, finally, the course takes us through integrating the Flux application with our backend.This course is a complete introduction to Flux, covering the new Flux paradigm and teaching how to create Flux and React web applications from the ground up.

Understand the fundamentals of full stack web developmentAbout This VideoA comprehensive guide to the standard aspects of full stack developmentTakes you from an absolute beginner to working with server-side technologies, and ready to make decide on a front-end technology, with a thorough and measured learning style to ensure you won't get lost along the wayIn DetailThis course covers the fundamentals of the baseline technologies that you need to know in order to become a full stack web developer. By the end of this course you will know how to work with: NPM, Node.js,Express.js, and MongoDB, and you will be ready to choose a front-end technology, such as Angular, for the MEAN stack, or React. Web development is evolving rapidly and developers need to know a much greater variety of technologies than they did historically. Whilst in the past you could specialize in a single area, such as client side development, modern web developers are expected to have an understanding of all areas and how they fit together. This 360-degree approach is known as full stack web development—a bundling of core technologies on the client and server side that provides an end-to-end web development solution. Through this course, you will become familiar with the standard set of core technologies behind modern full stack development, and you will learn the skills required to become competent and comfortable in all these environments. This course assumes you know JavaScript but does not assume you know any other technology. One of the biggest issues with most videos and titles on full stack development is that they assume too many things about the student. This title is the "Critical mass," the one course that will open your eyes to the world of full stack development.

This introduction to random walks on infinite graphs gives particular emphasis to graphs with polynomial volume growth. It offers an overview of analytic methods, starting with the connection between random walks and electrical resistance, and then proceeding to study the use of isoperimetric and Poincar&#233; inequalities. The book presents rough isometries and looks at the properties of a graph that are stable under these transformations. Applications include the 'type problem': determining whether a graph is transient or recurrent. The final chapters show how geometric properties of the graph can be used to establish heat kernel bounds, that is, bounds on the transition probabilities of the random walk, and it is proved that Gaussian bounds hold for graphs that are roughly isometric to Euclidean space. Aimed at graduate students in mathematics, the book is also useful for researchers as a reference for results that are hard to find elsewhere.

First issued in translation as a two-volume work in 1975, this classic book provides the first complete development of the theory of probability from a subjectivist viewpoint. It proceeds from a detailed discussion of the philosophical mathematical aspects to a detailed mathematical treatment of probability and statistics.De Finetti’s theory of probability is one of the foundations of Bayesian theory. De Finetti stated that probability is nothing but a subjective analysis of the likelihood that something will happen and that that probability does not exist outside the mind.  It is the rate at which a person is willing to bet on something happening.  This view is directly opposed to the classicist/ frequentist view of the likelihood of a particular outcome of an event, which assumes that the same event could be identically repeated many times over, and the 'probability' of a particular outcome has to do with the fraction of the time that outcome results from the repeated trials.

A fast-paced guide to getting started with the Machine Learning with RAbout This VideoDive into the essential know-how of Machine learning with R.Practical, real-world examples to help you master the various stages of machine learning using the R language.Look into important machine learning concepts such as linear and logistic regression, data scaling, and cross-validation.In DetailMachine learning is a subfield of computer science that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. It explores the study and construction of algorithms that can learn from, and make predictions on, data. The R language is widely used among statisticians and data miners to develop statistical software and perform data analysis. Machine Learning is a growing field that focuses on teaching computers to do work that was traditionally reserved for humans; it is a cross-functional domain that uses concepts from statistics, math, software engineering, and more.In this course you will start by organizing your data and then predicting it. Then you will work through various examples. The first example will demonstrate (using linear regression) predicting the murder arrest rate based on arrest data for a given State. Here you will explore R Studio and libraries, how to apply linear regression, how to score test sets, and plotting test results on a Cartesian plane. Then the next example will use logistic regression to predict for a classification problem on breast cancer: forecasting insurance types based on medical treatment. This example demonstrate labeling and scaling data, how cross-validation works, and how to apply Logistic regression. Finally you will move on the next example—automobile classification—where you will use the caret package in R to simplify some of these steps.By the end of this course, you will have mastered preparing data and the tools involved: regression and classification. Additionally, you will have learned to make predictions on new observations.

Assessment is a pervasive activity that can be approached uniformly. Humane assessment offers just such a concrete approach, rooted in the idea of engineers crafting custom tools to capture the specifics of the system at hand—and using these tools for effective decision making.In this video, we dive deeper into the nature of tools and how they affect the way we work. We show how the same skills and techniques that were described in Growing Agile Architecture by Empowering Teams are also applicable to a broader range of problems, and we introduce humane assessment as a systematic method for software assessment. The theoretical parts are exemplified with concrete case studies.

The important and rapidly emerging new field known as 'cyber threat intelligence' explores the paradigm that defenders of computer networks gain a better understanding of their adversaries by understanding what assets they have available for an attack. In this book, a team of experts examines a new type of cyber threat intelligence from the heart of the malicious hacking underworld - the dark web. These highly secure sites have allowed anonymous communities of malicious hackers to exchange ideas and techniques, and to buy/sell malware and exploits. Aimed at both cybersecurity practitioners and researchers, this book represents a first step toward a better understanding of malicious hacking communities on the dark web and what to do about them. The authors examine real-world darkweb data through a combination of human and automated techniques to gain insight into these communities, describing both methodology and results.

At the heart of quantum mechanics lies the wave function, a powerful but mysterious mathematical object which has been a hot topic of debate from its earliest stages. Covering much of the recent debate and providing a comprehensive and critical review of competing approaches, this ambitious text provides new, decisive proof of the reality of the wave function. Aiming to make sense of the wave function in quantum mechanics and to find the ontological content of the theory, this book explores new ontological interpretations of the wave function in terms of random discontinuous motion of particles. Finally, the book investigates whether the suggested quantum ontology is complete in solving the measurement problem and if it should be revised in the relativistic domain. A timely addition to the literature on the foundations of quantum mechanics, this book is of value to students and researchers with an interest in the philosophy of physics.

Examine and solve the common misconceptions and fallacies that non-statisticians bring to their interpretation of statistical results. Explore the many pitfalls that non-statisticians—and also statisticians who present statistical reports to non-statisticians—must avoid if statistical results are to be correctly used for evidence-based business decision making.Victoria Cox, senior statistician at the United Kingdom’s Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl), distills the lessons of her long experience presenting the actionable results of complex statistical studies to users of widely varying statistical sophistication across many disciplines: from scientists, engineers, analysts, and information technologists to executives, military personnel, project managers, and officials across UK government departments, industry, academia, and international partners.The author shows how faulty statistical reasoning often undermines the utility of statistical results even among those with advanced technical training. Translating Statistics teaches statistically naive readers enough about statistical questions, methods, models, assumptions, and statements that they will be able to extract the practical message from statistical reports and better constrain what conclusions cannot be made from the results. To non-statisticians with some statistical training, this book offers brush-ups, reminders, and tips for the proper use of statistics and solutions to common errors. To fellow statisticians, the author demonstrates how to present statistical output to non-statisticians to ensure that the statistical results are correctly understood and properly applied to real-world tasks and decisions. The book avoids algebra and proofs, but it does supply code written in R for those readers who are motivated to work out examples.Pointing along the way to instructive examples of statistics gone awry, Translating Statistics walks readers through the typical course of a statistical study, progressing from the experimental design stage through the data collection process, exploratory data analysis, descriptive statistics, uncertainty, hypothesis testing, statistical modelling and multivariate methods, to graphs suitable for final presentation. The steady focus throughout the book is on how to turn the mathematical artefacts and specialist jargon that are second nature to statisticians into plain English for corporate customers and stakeholders. The final chapter neatly summarizes the book’s lessons and insights for accurately communicating statistical reports to the non-statisticians who commission and act on them.

Master functions and discover how to write functional programs in R. In this concise book, you'll make your functions pure by avoiding side-effects; you’ll write functions that manipulate other functions, and you’ll construct complex functions using simpler functions as building blocks. In Functional Programming in R, you’ll see how we can replace loops, which can have side-effects, with recursive functions that can more easily avoid them. In addition, the book covers why you shouldn't use recursion when loops are more efficient and how you can get the best of both worlds. Functional programming is a style of programming, like object-oriented programming, but one that focuses on data transformations and calculations rather than objects and state. Where in object-oriented programming you model your programs by describing which states an object can be in and how methods will reveal or modify that state, in functional programming you model programs by describing how functions translate input data to output data. Functions themselves are considered to be data you can manipulate and much of the strength of functional programming comes from manipulating functions; that is, building more complex functions by combining simpler functions.
