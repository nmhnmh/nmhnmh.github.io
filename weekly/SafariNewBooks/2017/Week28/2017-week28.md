Only by understanding IT-driven business services and anchoring them in a service design statement (SDS) can enterprises translate business needs into IT-intensive business services.

In Collaborative Business Design &#8211; Improving and innovating the design of IT-driven business services, Brian Johnson and L&#233;on-Paul de Rouw comprehensively explain how to use business service design (BSD) to formulate an effective SDS that will help business and IT cooperate to create robust, efficient services that support business requirements.

 

Product overview
Collaborative Business Design delves into the inner workings of services, with the aim of making sure that each side &#8211; business and IT &#8211; understands the other&#8217;s needs and drivers so that services can deliver what is required, expected and promised throughout their lifecycle. It:

Examines the gap in understanding between IT and business.
Introduces BSD &#8211; an analytic approach to understanding the characteristics of IT-driven business services.
Provides an overview of the components and characteristics of IT-driven business services.
Considers the different parts of the BSD and SDS.
Offers insight into the design of IT-driven business services using BSD.
Discusses practical consequences for business transformation to continuously define, develop and improve services that customers want to use.
Full of useful diagrams and examples (and quotations from an unusual range of sources including Star Trek, Mick Jagger and Oscar Wilde), Collaborative Business Design explains how to guide the development, building, programme management, and maintenance of IT-driven business services.

 

Introducing business service design (BSD)
BSD is a simple approach to designing the overarching architecture of any IT-driven business service.

It merges the pragmatism and logic of the UK Government Gateway method with service blueprinting and the stakeholder approach to gaining consensus.

BSD is not an architecture for software development or for technology support &#8211; it complements existing frameworks such as TOGAF, IT4IT, BiSL&#174; Next and ITIL&#174; by focusing on business architecture, a subject rarely discussed before designing an IT-intensive, complex business service.

 

Who should read this book
This book is intended for anyone responsible for designing and implementing IT-driven services, or who is involved in their operation. This includes everyone on both sides of supply and demand, including:

Internal and external service providers, such as service managers, contract managers, bid managers, lead architects, requirement analysts
Business, financial, sales, marketing and operations managers who are responsible for output and outcome
Sales and product managers who need to present and improve service offerings
Developers who need to develop new and improved services

Explosive growth in computing power has made Bayesian methods for infinite-dimensional models - Bayesian nonparametrics - a nearly universal framework for inference, finding practical use in numerous subject areas. Written by leading researchers, this authoritative text draws on theoretical advances of the past twenty years to synthesize all aspects of Bayesian nonparametrics, from prior construction to computation and large sample behavior of posteriors. Because understanding the behavior of posteriors is critical to selecting priors that work, the large sample theory is developed systematically, illustrated by various examples of model and prior combinations. Precise sufficient conditions are given, with complete proofs, that ensure desirable posterior properties and behavior. Each chapter ends with historical notes and numerous exercises to deepen and consolidate the reader's understanding, making the book valuable for both graduate students and researchers in statistics and machine learning, as well as in application areas such as econometrics and biostatistics.

An introduction to Lean thinking

Lean is a mindset rather than a methodology; it is a way of thinking based on practices, strategies, tools and methods that can be applied to maximise value and minimise waste while ensuring that processes achieve corporate goals.

Lean helps organisations in all sectors achieve their objectives by facilitating a long-term culture shift focusing on three fundamental areas: waste , customer value and continuous incremental improvement. A good assurance review will ensure that resources are being applied efficiently and effectively to achieve these objectives.

 

Product overview

Fundamentals of Assurance for Lean Projects explains the fundamental concepts of Lean and how they can be applied to any project, including software development and organisational change.

It explains the jargon and dispels the mystique that surrounds Lean, providing readers with guidance and tips on performing audits or assurance reviews for Lean projects.

It also describes how Lean fits with Agile and Kanban, and how it can be combined with Six Sigma to create an efficient, high-quality approach. The book provides strong practical guidance for those tasked with providing assurance for Lean projects.

Read this book to learn about the approach and principles of Lean, the governance of Lean projects, and Lean audit and review. Topics covered include:

The five main Lean principles and their significance.
Tools used for root-cause analysis (the five whys and fishbone analysis).
Defining and modelling customer value, and innovative responses to customer needs (the Kano model).
Common causes of waste and how to improve flow.
Customer pull and Kanban mechanisms to manage the associated flow of processing and information.
The pursuit of perfection (Kaikaku and Kaizen) and total quality management (TQM).
The application of Lean principles to software development.
Practical suggestions for approaches to auditing.
As with all books in the Fundamentals Series, Fundamentals of Assurance for Lean Projects introduces the subject and includes references for those who would like to further investigate specific areas.

Get a sense of the awesome power of R by learning how complex things are done with easeAbout This VideoLearn a core set of operations so that you can do what you want with RUnderstand what is important in a problem by capturing new dimensions using Feature engineeringGenerate Complex Structures using Data VisualizationIn DetailIn this video course, we start by focusing on R’s similarities with programming languages such as basic/c/c# with loops and conditional tests like if, so that you can feel at home and be productive straight away.We begin by introducing R and setting things up so that you are ready to go using Rstudio, the associated IDE. Then we look at R as a programming language and see how the standard things are done in it, so you can see that it’s not that different from other programming languages. Next, we introduce some R commands, which are very useful and not as common in traditional languages since manipulating data is more important in R.Moving on, we look at an example in the Titanic dataset, which is the kind of thing you’ll come across in R, a multidimensional collection of variables of different types. Using the tools that we cover we can form a picture, a story behind the data.We then look at cleaning up data, which is what 80% of data science is - as we rarely get a nice neat set of numbers, but mostly unstructured junk. This is just trial and error, gradually getting to something we can work with.Finally, we cover statistics, which is where R originated and what it was designed for.We begin doing some basic statistics with R to show how it works and end up using various special features for data visualization.

What do people mean when they mention cgroups and namespaces, or when they describe a container as a “lightweight virtual machine”? In this course designed for the intermediate level programmer (any language), you’ll discover exactly what a container is by writing one with a surprisingly small amount of Go code.  Along the way, you'll lose your fear of syscalls and learn that a container is really just a Linux process with its view of the world limited through namespaces, cgroups, and chroot.

Are you spending too much on R&amp;D? Too little? Is your innovation program successful? And how do you measure that success?Your company is spending millions on R&amp;D every year, but despite your best efforts, that R&amp;D isn’t driving growth. If you’re like 95% of firms, you aren’t investing the right amount, and the productivity of your R&amp;D has fallen dramatically over the past several years. That’s because there hasn’t been a universal, uniform, and reliable measure of R&amp;D—until now.First introduced in Anne Marie Knott’s influential Harvard Business Review article, RQTM (Research Quotient) is a revolutionary new tool that measures a company’s R&amp;D capability—its ability to convert investment in R&amp;D into products and services people want to buy or to reduce the cost of producing these. RQ not only tells companies how “smart” they are, it provides a guide for how much they should invest in R&amp;D to ensure that investment will increase revenues, profits, and market value.Armed with insights from her experience as an R&amp;D project manager, 20 years of academic research, and two National Science Foundation grants, Knott devised RQ and used the measure to test common innovation prescriptions across the full spectrum of U.S. companies engaged in R&amp;D. The results are nothing short of game-changing.In this essential guide, you will learn:• how to use RQ to determine which R&amp;D investments are most likely to drive growth—using the hard data you already have to better utilize the innovation tools you’re already using
• the 7 misconceptions about innovation trends—and how to avoid the ones that don’t work
• how investors can achieve 9x returns in the market and help companies in the process
• why corporate—and GDP—growth has stalled and how to restore it without R&amp;D tax creditsThis book promises to do for innovation and R&amp;D what TQM did for manufacturing and what Sabremetrics did for baseball. It’ll show you How Innovation Really Works—with measurable results you can count on.

The growth of videogame design programs in higher education and explosion of amateur game development has created a need for a deeper understanding of game history that addresses not only "when," but "how" and "why." Andrew Williams takes the first step in creating a comprehensive survey on the history of digital games as commercial products and artistic forms in a textbook appropriate for university instruction. History of Digital Games adopts a unique approach and scope that traces the interrelated concepts of game design, art and design of input devices from the beginnings of coin-operated amusement in the late 1800s to the independent games of unconventional creators in the present. Rooted in the concept of videogames as designed objects, Williams investigates the sources that inspired specific game developers as well as establishing the historical, cultural, economic and technological contexts that helped shape larger design trends

This sixth edition of The Practical Zone System by Chris Johnson updates the classic manual on Ansel Adams's landmark technique for the digital age. For photographers working digitally or with film, in color or black and white, in the studio or on the go, this simple visual language helps to control contrast and, through a process called Previsualization, provides photographers with the power of free creative expression. This new edition discusses recent advances in technology and potentials for their use in zone photography, including HDR, smartphone cameras that shoot in raw format and smartphone light meters. Johnson demonstrates how the Zone System is a universal visual and conceptual language that dramatically simplifies the problem of creating and rendering complex lighting setups.

Performing the work of William Shakespeare can be daunting to new actors. Author Herb Parker posits that his work is played easier if actors think of the plays as happening out of outrageous situations, and remember just how non-realistic and presentational Shakespeare’s plays were meant to be performed. The plays are driven by language and the spoken word, and the themes and plots are absolutely out of the ordinary and fantastic—the very definition of outrageous. With exercises, improvisations, and coaching points, Acting Shakespeare is Outrageous! helps actors use the words Shakespeare wrote as a tool to perform him, and to create exciting and moving performances.

Learn how big data and other sources of information can be transformed into valuable knowledge - knowledge that can create incredible competitive advantage to propel a business toward market leadership.
Learn through examples and experience exactly how to pick projects and build analytics teams that deliver results. Know the ethical and privacy issues, and apply the three-part litmus test of context, permission, and accuracy. 


Without a doubt, data and analytics are the new source of competitive advantage, but how do executives go from hype to action? That's the objective of this book - to assist executives in making the right investments in the right place and at the right time in order to reap the full benefits of data analytics.


We are moving into an era where information is potentially more valuable 
than tangible things or services. Organizations who connect information with 
their product will have a huge advantage, and conversely organizations that miss 
this transformation will find themselves increasingly un-competitive. No longer 
just something for the Information Technologists or Data Scientists to deal 
with, everyone who makes things or serves customers in some way needs to 
understand how people interact with their product or service in a very granular 
way. This book will help people in business and government understand the power 
of data analytics technology and how some of the tools available can be applied 
to a wide range of applications.
John Swainson, former President, Dell Software Group



John and Shawn bring decades of hands on experience helping clients understand where and how data and analytics can deliver business value and market differentiation. The authors do not get bogged down in the technology tail-chase, but instead provides clear and actionable guidance on how organizations need to embrace a 
'business first' approach when considering how to exploit the business potential of big data. Like I ask my clients, 
"How effective is your organization at leveraging data and analytics to power your business?" It's a question this book will help you to address.

Bill Schmarzo, CTO Big Data, Dell Technologies Services 

One could argue - and probably easily win the argument - that there has been 
more change in analytics over the past ten years than at any time in the history 
of the world. For that reason alone, a book like this one that provides a 
clear-eyed assessment of the state of the art in analytics is enormously 
valuable.

Others may be checking out reactive programming just to see what it is all about, and to judge whether it can solve any problems they may have.What You Will LearnLearn the features of RxJava 2 that bring about many significant changes, including new reactive types such as Flowable, Single, Maybe, and CompletableUnderstand how reactive programming works and the mindset to "think reactively"Demystify the Observable and how it quickly expresses data and events as sequencesLearn the various Rx operators that transform, filter, and combine data and event sequencesLeverage multicasting to push data to multiple destinations, and cache and replay themDiscover how concurrency and parallelization work in RxJava, and how it makes these traditionally complex tasks trivial to implementApply RxJava and Retrolambda to the Android domain to create responsive Android apps with better user experiencesUse RxJava with the Kotlin language to express RxJava more idiomatically with extension functions, data classes, and other Kotlin featuresIn DetailRxJava is a library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs using Observable sequences for the JVM, allowing developers to build robust applications in less time.Learning RxJava addresses all the fundamentals of reactive programming to help readers write reactive code, as well as teach them an effective approach to designing and implementing reactive libraries and applications.Starting with a brief introduction to reactive programming concepts, there is an overview of Observables and Observers, the core components of RxJava, and how to combine different streams of data and events together. You will also learn simpler ways to achieve concurrency and remain highly performant, with no need for synchronization. Later on, we will leverage backpressure and other strategies to cope with rapidly-producing sources to prevent bottlenecks in your application. After covering custom operators, testing, and debugging, the book dives into hands-on examples using RxJava on Android as well as Kotlin.Style and approachThis book will be different from other Rx books, taking an approach that comprehensively covers Rx concepts and practical applications.Downloading the example code for this book.

Embedded with more than 20 design patternsIn DetailDesign patterns make developers’ life easy by efficiently addressing common problems faced during developing applications. Google’s Go is an open source programming language that helps you to build efficient and reliable software. The language has proved to be a powerful option in many software development domains.This Learning Path starts with a brief introduction to Go programming essentials and quickly moves on to explain the idea behind the creation of design patterns. You will learn how to apply the 23 Gang of Four (GoF) design patterns in Go. Next, you will explore the CSP concurrency patterns, the "killer feature" in Go that has helped Google develop software to maintain thousands of servers. You will then use the majority of Go primitives to write concurrent apps and also develop some classical design patterns with concurrent structures to maximize parallelism. You will see how a classical pattern can become more complex if you need it to work in a concurrent way; however, the idea is to understand Go concurrent primitives so that you know how to write your own concurrent design patterns by using the knowledge taken from this Learning Path.By the end of this Learning Path, you’ll understand and apply design patterns in an idiomatic way that will produce concise, readable, and maintainable software.Prerequisites: Basic programming knowledge would be beneficial, however it’s not mandatory.

The course will include different sections, each part adding an extra building block to the final product.We start the course by fostering a basic understanding and appreciation for the software, including installation, shortcuts, and viewport/panel navigation; this will help you efficiently navigate between windows and panels, and move objects with basic shortcuts. Next, we move on to the basic setup for modeling a simple object, including setting up and scaling reference images appropriately and manipulating a base mesh to build a new, more complex object to model a simple object from a reference image. Next we delve into the base workflow for creating a new 3D character from scratch using reference images and, utilizing the skin modifier, we will create a base mesh for our character and then add extra details to make the mesh look better and more lifelike. The next topic we will look at is rigging—how it works and why it makes life easier for the animator. You will then create a simple rig for your character and apply simple weight painting techniques to clean up the model. For the next step we will learn about simple materials in the Blender internal render engine as well as keyframe animation, while also learning how to add color materials to different parts of a character mesh so that you have a good understanding of how the animation system and timeline work within Blender. Finally we will learn how rendering works, the different settings for outputting an image or video, and how to stitch an image sequence together into a video file that will help you better understand which output files to use, depending on the situation.Upon completing this course, you will have mastered how to model, animate, and render out 3D models using Blender.

As my clients emerged from the global economic turmoil that began in 2008, I began to see what others didn&#8217;t see. Something was standing in their way&#8212;usually the unwillingness or inability to make a critical decision. They thought they needed more&#8212;more education, more experience, more time, or more data. They had enough of these, but they lacked the confidence, courage, and optimism to make the tough calls. Through our work together, we learned that when leaders make good decisions, little else matters. When they refuse to make decisions, or show a pattern of making bad ones, nothing else matters. The most successful leaders realized they could no longer push growth. Instead, they had to remove barriers to success&#8212;obstacles they had erected themselves. The compelling stories and surprising research findings in this book focus on real people who actively sought professional improvement and personal development. Working together, we mapped out their journeys, identified roadblocks, recognized the wrong turns they had taken, and unlocked their decision-making potential&#8212;in some cases, more than doubling the size of their companies. Most of these stories illustrate how and why these leaders succeed, but others serve as warnings about what can happen when leaders refuse to decide.

This book provides an understanding of the characteristics of corporate governance in Italy, one of the most developed countries in the world, symbol of the family capitalism. The text presents the main peculiarities of the Italian corporate governance system, its impact on decision-making in corporate boardrooms, and the potential positive and negative consequences for the firm and its stakeholders. Several real-life case studies were included to help the reader grasp the subtleties of how power is exercised in Italian companies. The authors combine their knowledge of research with their professional experience. Such an approach helps the reader interpret the nuances of corporate governance practices in Italian companies as those practices are driven not only by the globalization of markets, but also by national economic, social, and political forces. The result is a unique corporate governance system, which deeply differs from the Anglo-American one. This book is, therefore, particularly relevant for a wide international audience (including investors, corporate directors, scholars, and practitioners) as it provides useful insights to interpret, evaluate and take sound decisions in Italian companies.

Go is also cross-platform as it compiles to numerous operating systems and CPU architectures via simple commands. It compiles to native binaries, it doesn't use a VM, and is garbage-collected, which makes it a breeze to deploy in production environments.Throughout the course, we will use modern open source third party packages in Go to build a distributed application that will support several databases, establish efficient serial communications techniques, and construct an advanced web layer with templates, cookies, and websockets support.We will start with a refresher on Go's primary building blocks. From there, we will explore numerous open source packages that allow working with a variety of databases in a production environment as well as an ORM layer. We will then explore building reliable and robust microservices that communicate efficiently with each other via fast serialization and RPC techniques. Finally, we will develop knowledge on powerful third party templating engines and web toolkits, to construct a modern web layer with a RESTful API.
