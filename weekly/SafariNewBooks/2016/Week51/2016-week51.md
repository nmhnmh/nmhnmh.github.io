Humility Is the New Smart Your job is at risk—if not now, then soon. We are on the leading edge of a Smart Machine Age led by artificial intelligence that will be as transformative for us as the Industrial Revolution was for our ancestors. Smart machines will take over millions of jobs in manufacturing, office work, the service sector, the professions, you name it. Not only can they know more data and analyze it faster than any mere human, say Edward Hess and Katherine Ludwig, but smart machines are free of the emotional, psychological, and cultural baggage that so often mars human thinking. So we can't beat 'em and we can't join 'em. To stay relevant, we have to play a different game. Hess and Ludwig offer us that game plan. We need to excel at critical, creative, and innovative thinking and at genuinely engaging with others—things machines can't do well. The key is to change our definition of what it means to be smart. Hess and Ludwig call it being NewSmart. In this extraordinarily timely book, they offer detailed guidance for developing NewSmart attitudes and four critical behaviors that will help us adapt to the new reality. The crucial mindset underlying NewSmart is humility—not self-effacement but an accurate self-appraisal: acknowledging you can't have all the answers, remaining open to new ideas, and committing yourself to lifelong learning. Drawing on extensive multidisciplinary research, Hess and Ludwig emphasize that the key to success in this new era is not to be more like the machines but to excel at the best of what makes us human.

7 Principles for Finding Meaning in Life &amp; WorkWorld-renowned psychiatrist Viktor Frankl's Man's Search for Meaning is one of the most important books of modern times. Frankl's extraordinary personal story of finding meaning amid the horrors of the Nazi concentration camps has inspired millions. Frankl vividly showed that you always have the ultimate freedom to choose your attitude—you don't have to be a prisoner of your thoughts. Dr. Alex Pattakos—who was urged by Frankl to write Prisoners of Our Thoughts—and Elaine Dundon, a personal and organizational innovation thought leader, show how Frankl's wisdom can help readers find meaning in every moment of their lives. Drawing on the entire body of Frankl's work, they identify seven “core principles” and demonstrate how they can be applied to everyday life and work. This revised and expanded third edition features new stories, practical exercises, applications, and insights from the authors' new work in MEANINGology®. Three new chapters outline how we all can benefit by putting meaning at the core of our lives, work, and society.

The primary objective of the International Journal of Decision Support System Technology (IJDSST) is to provide comprehensive coverage for DMSS technology issues. The issues can involve, among other things, new hardware and software for DMSS, new models to deliver decision making support, dialog management between the user and system, data and model base management within the system, output display and presentation, DMSS operations, and DMSS technology management. Since the technology's purpose is to improve decision making, the articles are expected to link DMSS technology to improvements in the process and outcomes of the decision making process. Decision Making Support Systems (DMSS) are information systems that interactively support the decision making process of individuals and groups in life, public, and private organizations, and other entities. These systems include Decision Support Systems (DSS), Executive Information Systems (EIS), Executive Support systems (ESS), Management Support Systems (MSS), Knowledge Based Systems (KBS), Intelligent Decision Support Systems (IDSS) and Creativity Enhancing Systems (CES). A theme that all articles published in the IJDSST have in common is to define new technologies in support of decision making. These technologies can be developed from several points of view: methodological, theoretical or technical. Each DMSS is a vehicle that delivers effectively and efficiently information technology and decision technology to the system user at a local or networked workstation or online through the Internet. The areas addressed by published papers can be diverse, including but not limited to:architectures of DSS, functionalities, mathematical models ofproblem solving, algorithms, man-machine interface, methods or methodologies. Decision technology usually involves accounting, cognitive science, economic science, management science, statistical models, operational research models and multi-criteria analyses that describe the decision problem explicitly and provide algorithms and methodologies that generate recommended solutions. There are a number of excellent theoretical and applied scholarly journals that offer articles in many DMSS areas. None, however, have a primary focus on DMSS technology and its role in DMSS support for the decision making process. The IJDSST is the official journal publication of the Euro Working Group on Decision Support System (EWG-DSS) (https://ewgdss.wordpress.com/). Several special issues have been published from research conducted in this working group.This issue contains the following articles:Decision Trees and Financial VariablesThe Full Knowledge of Big Data in the Integration of Inter-Organizational Information: An Approach Focused on Decision MakingMaintenance Decision-Making Under the Cost Criterion and the Competing Risks ApproachEfficient Implementation of Hadoop MapReduce based Business Process Dataflow

Let's face it: most students don't take calculus because they find it intellectually stimulating. It's not ... at least for those who come up on the wrong side of the bell curve! There they are, minding their own business, working toward some non-science related degree, when ... BLAM! They get next semester's course schedule in the mail, and first on the list is the mother of all loathed college courses ... CALCULUS!Not to fear--Idiot's Guides: Calculus I is a curriculum-based companion book created with this audience in mind. This new edition continues the tradition of taking the sting out of calculus by adding more explanatory graphs and illustrations and doubling the number of practice problems! By the time readers are finished, they will have a solid understanding (maybe even a newfound appreciation) for this useful form of math. And with any luck, they may even be able to make sense of their textbooks and teachers.

Connect, engage, motivate, and inspire using top coaching techniquesCoaching Up! is about inspiring those who matter to you to achieve peak performance. Whether you are a coach, a business leader, a civic activist, a teacher, a counselor, or a parent, this book will offer you a powerful, highly effective way to connect to the people you care about and move them forward toward their best selves. In sports, coaches have developed ways of connecting with their players quickly in the "heat of the battle," inspiring them to perform to their fullest potential and "leave it all on the field." Interestingly, although these techniques have not been codified, great coaches have independently developed remarkably similar models. This book aligns these techniques and distills their essence into a fundamental skill set that anyone can use to connect with, support, and inspire his or her colleagues, teammates, friends, and family members. At its foundation, great coaching is based on a solid set of techniques that can be applied to all areas of life. Essentially, those skills boil down to forging authentic connections, providing genuine support, and offering concise direction.While our everyday pressures may be less intense than those of a championship, the long-term game is even more important. Why not borrow from the best to develop the skills and abilities to win every day?Inspire and motivate people to higher performanceImprove communication in high-stakes situationsBe more effective both professionally and sociallyGetting inside the way great coaching works gives you an unparalleled glimpse at the core of inspiration. A great coach can make the difference between a mediocre player and a world champion. What would that difference look like if you could inspire every colleague in your business? Everyone who matters to you in your personal life? You can be the source of empowerment and motivation that helps the people around you reach higher, go further, and achieve more. Coaching Up! gives you the game plan—and shows you how to run the plays.

Build, create, and deploy your own computer vision applications with the power of OpenCVAbout This BookThis book provides hands-on examples that cover the major features that are part of any important Computer Vision applicationIt explores important algorithms that allow you to recognize faces, identify objects, extract features from images, help your system make meaningful predictions from visual data, and much moreAll the code examples in the book are based on OpenCV 3.1 – the latest versionWho This Book Is ForThis is the perfect book for anyone who wants to dive into the exciting world of image processing and computer vision. This book is aimed at programmers with a working knowledge of C++. Prior knowledge of OpenCV or Computer Vision/Machine Learning is not required.What You Will LearnExplore the steps involved in building a typical computer vision/machine learning applicationUnderstand the relevance of OpenCV at every stage of building an applicationHarness the vast amount of information that lies hidden in images into the apps you buildIncorporate visual information in your apps to create more appealing softwareGet acquainted with how large-scale and popular image editing apps such as Instagram work behind the scenes by getting a glimpse of how the image filters in apps can be recreated using simple operations in OpenCVAppreciate how difficult it is for a computer program to perform tasks that are trivial for human beingsGet to know how to develop applications that perform face detection, gender detection from facial images, and handwritten character (digit) recognitionIn DetailComputer vision and machine learning concepts are frequently used in practical computer vision based projects. If you’re a novice, this book provides the steps to build and deploy an end-to-end application in the domain of computer vision using OpenCV/C++. At the outset, we explain how to install OpenCV and demonstrate how to run some simple programs. You will start with images (the building blocks of image processing applications), and see how they are stored and processed by OpenCV. You’ll get comfortable with OpenCV-specific jargon (Mat Point, Scalar, and more), and get to know how to traverse images and perform basic pixel-wise operations. Building upon this, we introduce slightly more advanced image processing concepts such as filtering, thresholding, and edge detection. In the latter parts, the book touches upon more complex and ubiquitous concepts such as face detection (using Haar cascade classifiers), interest point detection algorithms, and feature descriptors. You will now begin to appreciate the true power of the library in how it reduces mathematically non-trivial algorithms to a single line of code!The concluding sections touch upon OpenCV’s Machine Learning module. You will witness not only how OpenCV helps you pre-process and extract features from images that are relevant to the problems you are trying to solve, but also how to use Machine Learning algorithms that work on these features to make intelligent predictions from visual data!Style and approachThis book takes a very hands-on approach to developing an end-to-end application with OpenCV. To avoid being too theoretical, the description of concepts are accompanied simultaneously by the development of applications. Throughout the course of the book, the projects and practical, real-life examples are explained and developed step by step in sync with the theory.Downloading the example code for this book.

The basic working knowledge for the practicing control engineer in industry, offered here as a handy deluxe edition comprising two volumes each devoted to methods and practical problems. Focusing on the practical implementation, the methods volume provides readers with rapid access to process modelling and control, while including the theoretical background necessary. Throughout, the essential knowledge is built up from chapter to chapter, starting with laying the foundations in plant instrumentation and control. Modelling abilities are then developed by starting from simple time-loop algorithms and passing on to discrete methods, Laplace transforms, automata and fuzzy logic. In the end, readers have the means to design simple controllers on the basis of their own models, and to use more detailed models to test them. With its clarity and simplicity of presentation, and illustrated by more than 200 diagrams, the volume supports self-study and teaches readers how to apply the appropriate method for the application required, and how to handle problems in process control.  Bridging theory and practice, the second volume contains over 200 practical exercises and their solutions to develop the problem-solving abilities of process engineers. The problems were developed by the author during his many years of teaching at university and are kept brief, taken from the fields of instrumentation, modeling, plant control, control strategy design and stability of control. The algorithm flows and codes, which are mostly based on MATLAB?, are given in many cases and allow for easy translation into applications.

Like it or not, JavaScript is not going away. No matter what framework or "compiles-to-js" language or library you use, bugs and performance concerns will always be an issue if the underlying quality of your JavaScript is poor. Rewrites, including porting to the framework of the month are terribly expensive and unpredictable. The bugs won’t magically go away, and can happily reproduce themselves in a new context. To complicate things further, features will get dropped, at least temporarily.This book provides clear guidance on how best to avoid these pathological approaches to writing JavaScript. Bad code doesn’t have to stay that way. And making it better doesn’t have to be intimidating or unreasonably expensive.

Legend has it that Google deploys over a billion application containers a week. How is that possible? The company decided to share the process through an open source project called Kubernetes, which replicates many of the features found in its internal system. This practical book will prepare you to take advantage of everything the Kubernetes platform has to offer.Rather than an exact copy of its internal Borg system, Kubernetes is an upgrade based on lessons Google learned over the last decade. Kubernetes is also designed to integrate with the most robust container ecosystem: Docker. Developers and Ops practitioners can easily deploy a demo Kubernetes environment and kick the tires, but when it comes time to scale to hundreds of nodes, you’re going to need a reliable field guide: Kubernetes: Up and Running.

For years now, web developers have used powerful application servers like PHP and Node that could create our web apps. But recently there's been a shift between how much we can do on an application server versus how much we can do on the browser itself—as well as what we can do on a mobile app. This practical book shows readers how static site generators provide a powerful middle ground between a full app server deployment and a simple collection of static files.Written by two leading developers in the JavaScript community, this book teaches front-end designers, front-end developers, web developers, and web designers how static site generators work, the benefits you can expect, and what options are available. You'll learn how to deliver static site files to the end user exactly as they are on the server, without using a server-side language or a database, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

By improving attitudes and personal habits at all levels, you'll implement a positive cultural change with sustainable impact. Nonprofits are driven to do more, more, more, often with fewer and fewer resources; there comes a breaking point where passion dwindles under the weight of pressure, and the mission suffers as a result. This book shows you how to revamp your organization to do more and do it better, by putting cultural considerations at the heart of strategy.

The application of Bayesian Networks (BN) or Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBN) in dependability and risk analysis is a recent development. A large number of scientific publications show the interest in the applications of BN in this field.Unfortunately, this modeling formalism is not fully accepted in the industry. The questions facing today's engineers are focused on the validity of BN models and the resulting estimates. Indeed, a BN model is not based on a specific semantic in dependability but offers a general formalism for modeling problems under uncertainty.This book explains the principles of knowledge structuration to ensure a valid BN and DBN model and illustrate the flexibility and efficiency of these representations in dependability, risk analysis and control of multi-state systems and dynamic systems.Across five chapters, the authors present several modeling methods and industrial applications are referenced for illustration in real industrial contexts.

The relationship between technological and pedagogical innovation has recently created a new field of research at the crossroads between Psychology, Educational Sciences and Artificial Intelligence: Educational Robotics (ER).Through analysis of the achievable educational goals based on the technological status and specific learning modes of different types of robots, it is possible to define three pedagogical paradigms: learning robotics, learning with robotics, and learning by robotics.In this book we address these three paradigms through three themes: human representations of robots, the acceptance and trust shown when interacting with a humanoid, and learning favored by the development and programming of robots in an educational context. These themes allow the authors to fully explore, define and delimit this novel field of research for future application in educational and social contexts.Finally, the book discusses contributions and limitations which have emerged from different methodologies of research, potential educational applications, and concepts of human–robot interaction for the development of the above paradigms.

For more than 50 years, IBM® mainframes have supported an
extraordinary portion of the world’s computing work,
providing centralized corporate databases and mission-critical
enterprise-wide applications. IBM z™ Systems, the latest
generation of the IBM distinguished family of mainframe systems,
has come a long way from its IBM System/360 heritage. Likewise, its
IBM z/OS® operating system is far superior to its predecessors
in providing, among many other capabilities, world-class and
state-of-the-art support for the TCP/IP internet protocol
suite.TCP/IP is a large and evolving collection of communication
protocols that is managed by the Internet Engineering Task Force
(IETF), an open, volunteer organization. Because of its openness,
the TCP/IP protocol suite has become the foundation for the set of
technologies that form the basis of the internet. The convergence
of IBM mainframe capabilities with internet technology,
connectivity, and standards (particularly TCP/IP) is dramatically
changing the face of information technology and driving
requirements for even more secure, scalable, and highly available
mainframe TCP/IP implementations.The IBM z/OS Communications Server TCP/IP Implementation series
provides understandable, step-by-step guidance for enabling the
most commonly used and important functions of z/OS Communications
Server TCP/IP.This IBM Redbooks® publication is for people who install
and support z/OS Communications Server. It introduces z/OS
Communications Server TCP/IP, describes the system resolver, and
shows the implementation of global and local settings for single
and multi-stack environments. It presents implementation scenarios

Case studies and strategies for more effective multi-generational managementClash of the Generations explores this new and increasingly common workplace phenomenon, and provides strategies to help managers navigate this ever more complex maze. Traditionally, older workers would retire and make room for the next generation; instead, Baby Boomers are now prolonging their time in the workplace, yet the successive generations are still coming in. Senior leaders are now left to manage a blended workplace comprised of up to four generations—each with their own ideas of work ethic, work/life balance, long-term career goals, and much more. Management is challenging at the best of times, but the new prevalence of generation gaps—sometimes even layered—add an entirely new dimension to an already complex responsibility. This book presents case studies and interviews with representatives of companies with age-diverse workforces, detailing innovative strategies for smoothing out the bumps and helping everyone work together. Managers have long wished that their positions came with an instruction manual, and this book delivers with a host of effective inter-generational management strategies illustrated by real-world companies. Manage the multi-generation workplace more effectivelyNavigate the generational culture clashAdopt proven strategies for helping everyone get alongPromote a more positive culture amidst clashing expectationsEvery generation in the workplace has value, each has their own strengths, their own weaknesses, and their own unique talents. Each is indispensable, and when they come together as a synergistic force, they can be unstoppable. Effective management means bringing out the best in your workforce, and the strategies presented in Clash of the Generations help you streamline your varied workforce into a team more valuable than the sum of its parts.

Dig to the root of public fraud with deep exploration of theory, standards, and normsPreventing Fraud and Mismanagement in Government identifies common themes in public fraud and corruption, describes the forces that drive them, and provides an objective standard of good practices with no political bent. From Bridgegate to Iran-Contra, this book walks through the massive scandals that resulted from public mismanagement and fraud to illustrate how deeply-entrenched, entity-specific norms can differ from actual best practices. The discussion includes the theoretical underpinnings of public fraud, and how intense corporate culture and limited exposure to outside practice standards can lead to routine deviation from normal behavior and moral standards. You'll find a compendium of practices that illustrate actual norms, allowing you to compare your own agency's culture and operations to standard practice, and contrast the motivations for fraud in the public and private sectors. Public agencies and governmental entities are generally driven by a pubic benefit or goal, but are widely varied in the ability and desire to deliver value while retaining best practices. This book explicitly explores the common patterns of agency practices and cultural norms, and describes how they can easily cross over into illegal acts. Understand why fraud exists in the public sectorDiscover how your agency's mindset diverges from the normReview cases where agency practices diverged from best financial practicesLearn good practices in an objective, nonpolitical contextThe government/public sector provides some of the most basic services that are critical to a functioning society. Lacking a profit motive, these agencies nonetheless show a pattern of fraud and borderline behavior that could be mitigated with the adoption of standards and best practices. Preventing Fraud and Mismanagement in Government shares a canon of knowledge related to public operations and fraud, providing deep insight into the causes, solutions, and prevention.
