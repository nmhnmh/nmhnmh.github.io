Whatever the impact, it’s bound to be big with an estimated 25 billion networked devices coming online by 2020. In this insightful book, author Sean Smith explains that if we build the IoT the way we built the current Internet, we’re headed for trouble. He offers concrete answers rather than questions and fear.

Lossless information hiding is a technique that enables images to be authenticated and then restored to their original forms by removing the watermark and replacing the images which had been overwritten. Lossless Information Hiding in Images focuses on the lossless information hiding in our most popular media, images. In this book, lossless information hiding schemes for images are classified into three categories, i.e., spatial domain based, transform domain based and compressed domain based. Furthermore, the compressed domain based methods are classified into VQ based, BTC based and JPEG/JPEG2000 based. And thus, the classification of lossless hiding schemes covers all kinds of methods. This book introduces many status-of-the-art lossless hiding schemes, most of which come from the authors' publications in the past five years. After reading this book, readers can immediately grasp the status, the typical algorithms and the trend of the field of lossless information hiding.Focuses specially on lossless information hiding for imagesCovers the most common visual medium, images, and the most common compression schemes, JPEG and JPEG 2000Includes recent state-of-the-art techniques in the field of lossless image watermarkingPresents many status-of-the-art lossless hiding schemes, most of which come from the authors' publications in the past five years

The proliferation of Web-based technologies during the last decade may have given the impression of wide-spread changes in educational practices. In fact, we have only begun to scratch the surface of experiencing the vast impact these technologies could have on education. Viewed separately, Web-based technologies offer exciting possibilities for expanding the capacity to provide access to instruction and knowledge world-wide. However, and perhaps more importantly, viewing these technological advancements in a more dynamic context, forces educators and researchers to rethink the fundamental processes of teaching and learning . It's not just a simple matter of using a technical tool to supply time and place ubiquity but to accept the challenge of understanding the implications for the entire educational spectrum. Web-based teaching and learning begs the question of what exactly these technologies means for learners, teachers, program designers, academic experts, technical and administrative staff, institutional decision makers, training managers, publishers, and others. Although a considerable amount of exploration has been conducted regarding web-based learning technologies, the breadth and scope for dialogue and experimentation needs to be broadened. International Journal of Web-Based Learning and Teaching Technologies (IJWLTT) provides a place for the dialogue and support of a diverse community interested in taking the challenge further.This issue contains the following articles:Understanding the Impact of Individual Differences on Learner Performance Using Hypermedia SystemsMaturity Model for E-Learning Classroom, Bimodal and Virtual Courses in Higher Education: A Preliminary StudyPredicting Student Satisfaction and Outcomes in Online Courses Using Learning Activity IndicatorsFactors Affecting University Students' Intention to Use Cloud Computing in Jordan

Imagine what you could do with the time you spend writing emails every day.  Complexity is killing companies' ability to innovate and adapt, and simplicity is fast becoming the competitive advantage of our time. Why Simple Wins helps leaders and their teams move beyond the feelings of frustration and futility that come with so much unproductive work in today's corporate world to create a corporate culture where valuable, essential, meaningful work is the norm. By learning how to eliminate redundancies, communicate with clarity, and make simplification a habit, individuals and companies can begin to recognize which activities are time-sucks and which create lasting value.  Lisa Bodell's simplification method has several unique principles:  Simplification is a skill that's available to us all, yet very few leaders use it. Simplification is the right thing to do--for our customers, for our company, and for each other. Operating with simplification as our core business model will make it easier to be respectful of each other's time. Simplification drives culture, and culture in turn drives employee engagement, customer relations, and overall productivity. This book is inspired by Bodell's passion for eliminating barriers to innovation and productivity. In it, she explains why change and innovation are so hard to achieve--and it's not what you might expect. The reality is this: we spend our days drowning in mundane tasks like meetings, emails, and reports. These are often self-created complexities that prevent us from getting to the meaningful work that truly matters.  Using simple stories and techniques, Why Simple Wins shows that by using simplicity as an operating principle, we can eliminate the busy work that puts a chokehold on us every day, and instead spend time on the work that we value.

Interwoven with the projects, there are demonstrations of best practices and design patterns, and techniques you can carry over to your own projects.The projects also demonstrate the key features of Go in action, such as concurrency, and will start to explore the rich ecosystem of open source libraries and frameworks that are being continually developed for the language.By the end of this course, you will have everything you need to go out into the wild with Go to build projects of your own.

1 + 1 = 100 guides readers through developing, implementing, and maintaining close relationships within their own company (employees, design engineering, product development, sales and marketing, operations, and supply chain) as well out outside (suppliers, customers, and the community). By avoiding overreliance on cost reduction measures and instead developing partnerships, the company, and its partners can achieve world-class profitability and cash flow. For more than 30 years, the focus in industry has been to improve productivity and cut costs using approaches like Lean Thinking, World Class Manufacturing, Reengineering, Strategic Supply Chain strategies, and off-shoring. Unlike the techniques that these process improvement methods espouse, partnerships go beyond correcting mistakes or solving problems; they entail looking at the big picture and building on each partner&#8217;s strengths, making breakthrough results possible for all stakeholders in the relationship. 1 + 1 = 100 speaks directly to operations and supply chain executives in manufacturing and distribution environments, but the concepts are essential for all members of the executive team in any industry that has an operations component and suppliers.

The number of devices we use on a daily basis is growing, with different devices playing different role at different times. Our ability as designers to control where users are coming from and how they get around the experiences we design is fading. Yet our need to ensure we understand where they are in their journey, so that we can deliver the right content and interactions at the right time and on the right device, is ever more important.By examining tried-and-tested storytelling principles from film, fiction, and music and applying them to the context of design and business, this book takes you on a journey to explore why storytelling matters and how you can apply it to your multi-device design projects and to your organization. For UX designers who want to learn how to apply simple storytelling tools, this comprehensive guide is a must.

Discover the Real Revolution Unfolding across AmericaAmerica faces huge challenges—climate change, social injustice, racist violence, economic insecurity. Journalist Sarah van Gelder suspected that there were solutions, and she went looking for them, not in the centers of power, where people are richly rewarded for their allegiance to the status quo, but off the beaten track, in rural communities, small towns, and neglected urban neighborhoods. She bought a used pickup truck and camper and set off on a 12,000-mile journey through eighteen states, dozens of cities and towns, and five Indian reservations. From the ranches of Montana to the coalfields of Kentucky to the urban cores of Chicago and Detroit, van Gelder discovered people and communities who are remaking America from the ground up. Join her as she meets the quirky and the committed, the local heroes and the healers who, under the mass media's radar, are getting stuff done. The common thread running through their work was best summed up by a phrase she saw on a mural in Newark: “We the People LOVE This Place.” That connection we each have to our physical and ecological place, and to our human community, is where we find our power and our best hopes for a new America.

Stop Seeking Happiness; Just Get Out of Its Way!Happiness is our natural state, for each of us and for humanity as a whole, argues John Izzo. But that happiness is being stolen by insidious mental patterns that he depicts as thieves: the thief of control, the thief of conceit, the thief of coveting, the thief of consumption, and the thief of comfort. He discovered these thieves as he sought the true source of happiness during a year-long sabbatical, walking the Camino de Santiago in Spain and living in the Andes of Peru. This thoughtful and inspiring book describes the disguises these thieves wear, the tools they use to break into our hearts, and how to lock them out once and for all. Izzo shows how these same thieves of personal happiness are destroying society as well. This book will help us all discover, develop, and defend the happiness that is our true nature while creating a world we all want to live in.

This book is for everyone who wants to make better forecasts. It is not about mathematics and statistics. It is about following a well-established forecasting process to create and implement good forecasts. This is true whether you are forecasting global markets, sales of SKUs, competitive strategy, or market disruptions. Today, most forecasts are generated using software. However, no amount of technology and statistics can compensate for a poor forecasting process. Forecasting is not just about generating a number. Forecasters need to understand the problems they are trying to solve. They also need to follow a process that is justifiable to other parties and be implemented in practice. This is what the book is about. Accurate forecasts are essential for predicting demand, identifying new market opportunities, forecasting risks, disruptions, innovation, competition, market growth and trends. Companies can navigate this daunting landscape and improve their forecasts by following some well-established principles. This book is written to provide the fundamentals business leaders need in order to make good forecasts. These fundamentals hold true regardless of what is being forecast and what technology is being used. It provides the basic foundational principles all companies need to achieve competitive forecast accuracy.

Programming is an important part of experimental psychology and cognitive neuroscience, and Python is an ideal language for novices. It sports a very readable syntax, intuitive variable management, and a very large body of functionality that ranges from simple arithmetic to complex computing. 
Python for Experimental Psychologists provides researchers without prior programming experience with the knowledge they need to independently script experiments and analyses in Python. The skills it offers include: how to display stimuli on a computer screen; how to get input from peripherals (e.g. keyboard, mouse) and specialised equipment (e.g. eye trackers); how to log data; and how to control timing. In addition, it shows readers the basic principles of data analysis applied to behavioural data, and the more advanced techniques required to analyse trace data (e.g. pupil size) and gaze data.Written informally and accessibly, the book deliberately focuses on the parts of Python that are relevant to experimental psychologists and cognitive neuroscientists. It is also supported by a companion website where you will find colour versions of the figures, along with example stimuli, datasets and scripts, and a portable Windows installation of Python.
