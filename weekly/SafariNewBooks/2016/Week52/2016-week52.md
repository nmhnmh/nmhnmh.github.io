This is the first book on the global auto industry viewed through the lens of technology. It starts by tracing how innovation shaped the first century of its history, then it examines the industry&#8217;s shifting footprint in Europe and North America, and the rise of new producers, particularly China. Succeeding chapters emphasize the role of suppliers in what is now a high-tech industry. This book describes new forms of collaboration that challenge traditional supply chain relations, analyzing regulation as a driver of innovation, and the enabling role of the materials science revolution, such as the shift of steel from a commodity to a highly engineered product. It covers innovations in management, from computer-aided engineering, roadmapping, and just-in-time methods to the evolving role of workers and public policy. The authors finish with an overview of electric vehicles, shared mobility, and autonomous vehicles, concluding that they will not prove disruptive.

<div class="safaribook"><h2><a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/weathering-the-storm/9781631576812/">Weathering the Storm</a></h2><p><img src="http://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/cover/9781631576812/" alt="Weathering the Storm"><ul><li>Authors: <strong>Javier Villar Burke</strong></li><li>Topic: <strong>Politics & Global Issues</strong></li><li>ISBN: <strong>9781631576812</strong></li><li>Publisher: <strong>Business Expert Press</strong></li></ul>
Weathering the Storm explores the factors leading up to the recent global financial and economic crisis, how the crisis unfolded, and the response of European and national authorities. The book describes the rationale behind the measures undertaken to mitigate the consequences of the recession and to ensure that a similar situation does not happen again in the future. In the wake of the crisis, various major changes continue to significantly affect the life and social organization of Europeans. For instance, a new ESM with a size financially comparable to that of the IMF was created; similarly, the reforms in economic governance imply much more intrusive participation of European countries in each other's macroeconomic policies. Moreover, the organization, regulation, and supervision of the financial sector have been drastically revamped. The decisions taken by European and national authorities affect the daily lives of hundreds of millions of European citizens and countless more around the globe. An insightful read for anyone interested in understanding the topic and its effect on their lives, the book primarily addresses undergraduate students in their final year and graduate students in fields such as economics, finance, and political science. The main messages are explained through examples and charts.

The very latest research shows that a process approach to interviewing provides greater structure and has the potential for significantly reducing bias. Learn how to deter and filter the poor performers and benefit from structured prewritten score able questions that will really make a difference to interviewing effectiveness and securing talented people. In a time when all organizations are striving to get the best talented people, it makes sense for organizations to upgrade and review their interviewing procedures and incorporate whatever techniques are available to reduce interviewing errors. The evidence shows that many HR functions have failed in the past to understand the long-term financial consequences of poor performance or to realize that talented people do so much more work than other employees. Financial examples are shown in this book using data from the 2015 work done survey. Successful talent recruitment is critical to any organization&#8217;s long-term success. This book gives you a detailed guide to the entire nine-step process with worked examples.

The superabundance of data that is created by today's businesses
is making storage a strategic investment priority for companies of
all sizes. As storage takes precedence, the following major
initiatives emerge:Flatten and converge your network: IBM® takes an open,
standards-based approach to implement the latest advances in the
flat, converged data center network designs of today. IBM Storage
solutions enable clients to deploy a high-speed, low-latency
Unified Fabric Architecture.Optimize and automate virtualization: Advanced virtualization
awareness reduces the cost and complexity of deploying physical and
virtual data center infrastructure.Simplify management: IBM data center networks are easy to
deploy, maintain, scale, and virtualize, delivering the foundation
of consolidated operations for dynamic infrastructure
management.
Storage is no longer an afterthought. Too much is at stake.
Companies are searching for more ways to efficiently manage
expanding volumes of data, and to make that data accessible
throughout the enterprise. This demand is propelling the move of
storage into the network. Also, the increasing complexity of
managing large numbers of storage devices and vast amounts of data

Thermodynamic degradation science is a new and exciting discipline. This book merges the science of physics of failure with thermodynamics and shows how degradation modeling is improved and enhanced when using thermodynamic principles. The author also goes beyond the traditional physics of failure methods and highlights the importance of having new tools such as “Mesoscopic” noise degradation measurements for prognostics of complex systems, and a conjugate work approach to solving physics of failure problems with accelerated testing applications. Key features: • Demonstrates how the thermodynamics energy approach uncovers key degradation models and their application to accelerated testing. • Demonstrates how thermodynamic degradation models accounts for cumulative stress environments, effect statistical reliability distributions, and are key for reliability test planning. • Provides coverage of the four types of Physics of Failure processes describing aging: Thermal Activation Processes, Forced Aging, Diffusion, and complex combinations of these. • Coverage of numerous key topics including: aging laws; Cumulative Accelerated Stress Test (CAST) Plans; cumulative entropy fatigue damage; reliability statistics and environmental degradation and pollution. Thermodynamic Degradation Science: Physics of Failure, Accelerated Testing, Fatigue and Reliability Applications is essential reading for reliability, cumulative fatigue, and physics of failure engineers as well as students on courses which include thermodynamic engineering and/or physics of failure coverage.

Recent years have seen a huge growth in European cross-border mergers and acquisitions (M&A), and considerable attention has been given to how such deals arise and are completed. A U.S. investor must understand the basic difference in the principle of individual labor law in the U.S. and how it compares with the laws of the target country in an M&A. In the U.S., under the employment at-will doctrine, the U.S. private sector employers can dismiss their non-unionized employees at any time for any reason or even no reason at all. In most European Union (EU) countries and Germany and Italy specifically, employees are presumed to have a basic right to keep their jobs indefinitely. One of the greatest labor cost disparity with the U.S. is not wages. It is the amount of paid time-off and other benefits. Employers in Germany and Italy will find it difficult to discharge employees without incurring substantial liability. For high-level, long-term employees, these severance payments can run into six or even seven figures.

In an increasingly turbulent and competitive world, organizations are constantly working to improve. Many organizations look to one of many continuous process improvement methodologies available today. Leaders who have been able to reap the benefits of continuous improvement behave in very specific ways. Their behaviors are centered on imbedding specific values, assumptions and beliefs that support continuous improvement into the way their organization executes the processes necessary to produce goods and services. To improve, leaders must first understand what culture is and how it impacts everything the organization does. We describe the key values, assumptions, beliefs and leadership behaviors we&#8217;ve found to be effective in organizations working to constantly improve the way work is done.

Weathering the Storm explores the factors leading up to the recent global financial and economic crisis, how the crisis unfolded, and the response of European and national authorities. The book describes the rationale behind the measures undertaken to mitigate the consequences of the recession and to ensure that a similar situation does not happen again in the future. In the wake of the crisis, various major changes continue to significantly affect the life and social organization of Europeans. For instance, a new ESM with a size financially comparable to that of the IMF was created; similarly, the reforms in economic governance imply much more intrusive participation of European countries in each other's macroeconomic policies. Moreover, the organization, regulation, and supervision of the financial sector have been drastically revamped. The decisions taken by European and national authorities affect the daily lives of hundreds of millions of European citizens and countless more around the globe. An insightful read for anyone interested in understanding the topic and its effect on their lives, the book primarily addresses undergraduate students in their final year and graduate students in fields such as economics, finance, and political science. The main messages are explained through examples and charts.

Interest in the Scala programming language
continues to grow for many reasons. Scala embraces the functional
programming style without abandoning the object-oriented paradigm,
and it allows you to write programs more concisely than in Java.
Because Scala runs on the JVM, it can access any Java library and
is interoperable with familiar Java frameworks. Scala also makes it
easier to leverage the full power of concurrency.Written for experienced Java, C++, or C#
programmers who are new to Scala or functional programming,
Scala for the Impatient, Second Edition, introduces
the key Scala concepts and techniques you need in order to be
productive quickly. It is the perfect introduction to the language,
particularly for impatient readers who want to learn the
fundamentals of Scala so they can start coding quickly. It
doesn’t attempt to exhaustively list all the features of the
language or make you suffer through long and contrived examples.
Instead, carefully crafted examples and hands-on activities guide
you through well-defined stages of competency, from basic to
expert.This revised edition has been thoroughly
updated for Scala 2.12 and reflects current Scala usage. It
includes added coverage of recent Scala features, including string
interpolation, dynamic invocation, implicit classes, and futures.
Scala is a big language, but you can use it effectively without
knowing all of its details intimately. This title provides
precisely the information that you need to get started in compact,
easy-to-understand chunks.Get started quickly with Scala’s interpreter, syntax,
tools, and unique idiomsMaster core language features: functions, arrays, maps, tuples,
