Successful innovation doesn’t begin with a brainstorming session—it starts with the customer. So in an age of unlimited data, why do more than 50% of new products fail to meet expectations? The truth is that we need to stop asking customers what they want . . . and start examining what they need.First popularized by Clayton Christensen, the Jobs to be Done theory argues that people purchase products and services to solve a specific problem. They’re not buying ice cream, for example, but celebration, bonding, and indulgence.The concept is so simple (and can remake how companies approach their markets) — and yet many have lacked a way to put it into practice. This book answers that need. Its groundbreaking Jobs Roadmap guides you through the innovation process, revealing how to:Gather valuable customer insightsTurn those insights into new product ideasTest and iterate until you find successFollow the steps in Jobs to Be Done, and you’ll arrive at solutions that are both original and profitable.

Overcoming Information Poverty: Investigating the Role of Public Libraries in The Twenty-First Century considers the role of public libraries in alleviating information poverty and targeting social exclusion, using a three-level information poverty framework. The book proposes a model for understanding the concept of information poverty, develops indicators for its measurement, and provides recommendations for service improvement based on analysis of public library services at macro (strategic), meso (community) and micro (individual) levels. The topic is of theoretical and practical importance when considering the changing role of public libraries today. The book is the first time a macro, meso, and micro model of information poverty indicators has been developed and applied to illustrate the impact of public libraries at strategic, community, and personal levels.Stimulates thinking and debate on information poverty and how it may be addressed by public libraries, education departments, and governmentsUses case studies to investigate how information poverty can be tackled at the macro, meso, and micro levelFocuses on how strategic policies to reduce information poverty filter through to community-based interventions within branch librariesDiscusses mixed methods, using quantitative and qualitative data, surveys, interviews, and focus groups with library users and non-users, to conduct a three-level investigation of information poverty

One of the most powerful features of React is that it follows a radically different method of application development. It moves away from the traditional monolithic approach and re-orients developers to creating in a fully componentized manner. This requires a completely different way of thinking that can be unfamiliar to developers trained in the old ways.This course will help you understand the power behind this new approach and show you how to build componentized apps and sites with reusable functionality. You will learn about the changes in ES6, and how they are important to React development, and how you can use Babel to use those features in current browsers. You will use JSX to create reusable components and learn how to pass parameters between them to create reactive sites. The course also dives into building Single-Page Applications (SPAs) using isomorphic JavaScript for a more dynamic experience.

Data scientists are faced with the need to conduct continual experiments, particularly regarding user interface and product marketing. Designing experiments is a cornerstone of the practice of statistics, with clear application to data science. In this lesson, you’ll learn about A-B testing and hypothesis, or significance tests—critical aspects of experimental design for data science.What you’ll learn—and how you can apply itYou'll learn the central concepts of A-B testing, understand its role in designing and conducting data science experiments, and the characteristics of a proper A-B test. Through a series of sample tests, you’ll learn how to interpret results, and apply that insight to your analysis of the data. Since A-B tests are typically constructed with a hypothesis in mind, you’ll also learn how to conduct various hypothesis, or significance tests, enabling you to avoid misinterpreting randomness.This lesson is for you because:You are a data scientist or analyst working with data, and want to gain beginner-level knowledge of key statistical concepts to improve the design and outcome of your experimental tests with data.Prerequisites:Basic familiarity with coding in RMaterials or downloads needed:None

Statistical methods are central to the techniques involved in capturing value from data. While there are many resources that teach basic statistics, it’s not as common to find statistics approached through a data science perspective. In this lesson, you’ll learn about key statistical concepts—sampling distribution and variability, bootstrapping, and confidence intervals—as they relate directly to data science.What you’ll learn—and how you can apply itYou'll learn how sampling distribution and sampling variability impact the results of statistical and machine learning models and impact your data quality. You’ll also learn the bootstrap procedure—an easy and effective way to estimate the sampling distribution of a statistic, or of model parameters. Discover how to utilize confidence intervals—a method to express the potential error in a sample estimate, and present your estimates as an interval range, to communicate the potential error in an estimate, and learn whether you need a larger sample of data.

An overview of metadata, where we define metadata (and not your typical “data about data” definition), and see many examples such as documents and spreadsheets. 
A history of metadata. Metadata has been in existence from the very first program that was written. Forms of early metadata are files names, variable names, programs, and directories. Much of this data should be stored in a data dictionary. We cover the benefits of data dictionaries as well as their drawbacks.
Metadata lineage, a recording of the data flows from one system to the next, along with how this data becomes transformed, recalculated, aggregated, summarized, or otherwise edited. 
 The different types of metadata including technical metadata, business metadata, local metadata, and enterprise metadata.
 The important role that metadata plays within a data warehouse architecture. Both local and enterprise levels are discussed.

Rough Cuts / Sneak Peek:The Rough Cuts/Sneak Peek program provides early access to Pearson video products and is exclusively available to Safari subscribers. Content for titles in this program is made available throughout the development cycle, so products may not be complete, edited, or finalized, including video post-production editing.The term “microservices” has gained significant traction over the last few years. Describing a specific style of distributed software architecture, microservices are small, independently deployable units that work together to form a complete system. Microservices live on the web, live in the cloud, and work with all manner of data (SQL, NoSQL, In-Memory). They are production-ready services driven by ever-changing demands and scale.Java developers looking to adopt microservices need to consider the practical aspects of application development. How can services be developed quickly? How can a broad range of technologies be supported? How can a consistent programming model be kept? For many companies, the answer is Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, and the wider Spring ecosystem.DescriptionIn this video training, Josh Long and Phil Webb demonstrate how and why Spring and Spring Boot offer the best way to build modern microservice systems. They look at the technologies and use-cases common to cloud-native microservice style applications as part of a larger framework, and then specifically address microservice implementation patterns.About the InstructorsJosh Long is the Spring Developer Advocate at Pivotal. He is a lead author, or co-author, on six books on Spring for Apress and O'Reilly; a frequent speaker at conferences worldwide; a JavaOne rockstar; and also the instructor on the first two Spring LiveLessons videos. He is a contributor to various Spring projects (including Spring Boot) and an all-around Spring fan. You can follow Josh on Twitter: @starbuxmanPhil Webb is the current lead of Spring Boot and a core contributor to the Spring Framework. He has been working with open source for many years and regularly talks at conferences and Java User groups. When he’s not developing code, Phil is kept busy by his young son. Phil is fortunate enough to be employed by Pivotal to work full-time on Spring. You can follow Phil on Twitter: @phillip_webb
