Provides an important framework for data analysts in assessing the quality of data and its potential to provide meaningful insights through analysisAnalytics and statistical analysis have become pervasive topics, mainly due to the growing availability of data and analytic tools. Technology, however, fails to deliver insights with added value if the quality of the information it generates is not assured. Information Quality (InfoQ) is a tool developed by the authors to assess the potential of a dataset to achieve a goal of interest, using data analysis.  Whether the information quality of a dataset is sufficient is of practical importance at many stages of the data analytics journey, from the pre-data collection stage to the post-data collection and post-analysis stages. It is also critical to various stakeholders: data collection agencies, analysts, data scientists, and management. This book:Explains how to integrate the notions of goal, data, analysis and utility that are the main building blocks of data analysis within any domain.Presents a framework for integrating domain knowledge with data analysis.Provides a combination of both methodological and practical aspects of data analysis.Discusses issues surrounding the implementation and integration of InfoQ in both academic programmes and business / industrial projects.Showcases numerous case studies in a variety of application areas such as education, healthcare, official statistics, risk management and marketing surveys.Presents a review of software tools from the InfoQ perspective along with example datasets on an accompanying website. This book will be beneficial for researchers in academia and in industry, analysts, consultants, and agencies that collect and analyse data as well as undergraduate and postgraduate courses involving data analysis.

A clear roadmap for the new territory of educationEducation in the U.S. has been under fire for quite some time, and for good reason. The numbers alone tell a very disconcerting story: according to various polls, 70% of teachers are disengaged. Add to that the fact that the United States ranks last among industrialized nations for college graduation levels, and it's evident there's a huge problem that needs to be addressed. Yet the current education system and its school buildings—with teachers standing in front of classrooms and lecturing to students—have gone largely unchanged since the 19th century. Humanizing the Education Machine tackles this tough issue head-on. It describes how the education system has become ineffective by not adapting to fit students' needs, learning styles, perspectives, and lives at home. This book explains how schools can evolve to engage students and involve parents. It serves to spread hope for reform and equip parents, educators, administrators, and communities to: Analyze the pitfalls of the current U.S. education systemIntelligently argue the need to reform the current landscape of educationWork to make a difference in the public education systemBe an informed advocate for your child or local school systemIf you're a concerned parent or professional looking for a trusted resource on the need for education reform, look no further than Humanizing the Education Machine.

Empowerment produces the conditions for high performance. Especially for middle managers and below.Empowered cultures attract and retain talent. They produce high achievement, high accountability and high commitment.The Empowered Manager uncovers a roadmap to creating a more accountable culture in today's fragmented and virtual world. Bestselling author Peter Block is a true visionary: author of the classic Flawless Consulting, his work is about empowerment, stewardship, chosen accountability, and reconciliation of community. In this book, he returns his eye toward management to renew our efforts to create a shift in the traditional hierarchy. Twenty years after the original book, Block talks of why it is so difficult to both open the door to empowerment and more importantly, have people walk through it. It is more important than ever to create a culture in which all members of an organization are treated as entrepreneurs, giving them ownership over their role and responsibilities. This is in the face of the reality that most employees want safety, not the adventure of empowerment. Peter enhances the first edition of the book by acknowledging employees wish for dependency. Their longing for the days when a job carried a promise of a future, and companies cared more about the product and the people, than about the money. This is written primarily for people in the middle. Good managers and employees who care more about doing good work and treating people right, than ambition and making it into the ruling class. The upper middle and below is where there is the greatest need for great management. Which builds on valuing strengths, and allowing talent the space to stretch and achieve. Almost independent of the power points of people at the top. This book shows you how a new approach to management empowers all employees at all levels, and culminates in better business outcomes for the entire organization. Help shape a culture of commitmentDevelop the political skills to negotiate successfullyTake responsibility for your actionsLearn to fail up, and face setbacks with courageIf you feel controlled by bureaucracy, unrewarded for creativity, and from a distance, powerless to control your own destiny, this book is the breath of fresh air your career has been craving. Timeless tips from a master of business strategy alongside a framework for more effective management makes The Empowered Manager a must-read guide for anyone doing business today.

Applications which use wireless sensors are increasing in number. The emergence of wireless sensor networks has also motivated the integration of a large number of small and lightweight nodes which integrate sensors, processors, and wireless transceivers.  Existing books on wireless sensor networks mainly focus on protocols and networks and pay little attention to the sensors themselves which the author believes is the main focus.  Without adequate knowledge of sensors as well as how they can be designed, realized and used, books on wireless sensor networks become too theoretical and irrelevant. The purpose of this book is to intimately acquaint readers with the technique of sensing (resistive, capacitive, inductive, magnetic, inertial, etc.) and existing sensor technologies. It also discusses how the sensors are used in a wide application domain and how new sensors can be designed and used in a novel way.

This book focuses on the emerging research topic "green (energy efficient) wireless networks" which has drawn huge attention recently from both academia and industry. This topic is highly motivated due to important environmental, financial, and quality-of-experience (QoE) considerations. Specifically, the high energy consumption of the wireless networks manifests in approximately 2% of all CO2 emissions worldwide. This book presents the authors’ visions and solutions for deployment of energy efficient (green) heterogeneous wireless communication networks. The book consists of three major parts. The first part provides an introduction to the "green networks" concept, the second part targets the green multi-homing resource allocation problem, and the third chapter presents a novel deployment of device-to-device (D2D) communications and its successful integration in Heterogeneous Networks (HetNets).The book is novel in that it specifically targets green networking in a heterogeneous wireless medium, which represents the current and future wireless communication medium faced by the existing and next generation communication networks. The book focuses on multi-homing resource allocation, exploiting network cooperation, and integrating different and new network technologies (radio frequency and VLC), expanding the network coverage and integrating new device centric communication paradigms such as D2D Communications. Whilst the book discusses a significant research topic supported with advanced mathematical analysis, the resulting algorithms and solutions are explained and summarized in a way that is easy to follow and grasp. This book is suitable for networking and telecommunications engineers, researchers in industry and academia, as well as students and instructors.

Eavesdrop on a top business leader to learn the secrets of great leadershipBuilding People provides a glimpse into the mind of one of Asia’s keenest and most effective business leaders. Before becoming Chairman of Changi Airport Group and Surbana Jurong, author Mun Leong Liew was named Best CEO in Singapore, Best CEO in Asia, CEO of the Year, Outstanding CEO of the Year, and more—but his successes are not based strictly upon the numbers. This book reveals the personal and professional philosophy behind this extraordinarily effective leader, in the context of frank and insightful emails to his staff. Touching on everything from honour and potential to training and mentorship, these messages paint a clear picture of the difference between good and great leadership. Effective leaders build companies, but legendary leaders build people—by strengthening the heart of your organisation, you enable robust growth and dynamic stability from the inside out.These emails go beyond mere public relations to lay open the true nature of a man who is honestly, deeply committed to his job, his responsibility, his organisation, and most of all, his people.Learn why work-life balance is not a zero-sum gameDiscover what pragmatism and commitment truly mean in businessRealise the importance of good partnerships and unsung heroesManage change effectively and employ it wisely for sustainable successBy eavesdropping on a leader’s communications with the people he serves, you get a real sense of the man behind the success. Great leadership is rooted in a philosophy of “building up” instead of tearing down, and motivated by the sincere belief that we bring our own purpose into everything we do. Building People brings great leadership to life, and inspires action over theory through the insights of Mun Leong Liew.

Delve into gender lens investing and the reality of the female economyWomen today are an unparalleled force in the global economy—as successful entrepreneurs, corporate executives and family breadwinners. Yet gender-based violence, the absence of women's legal rights and the persistent wage gap stubbornly remain. This paradox creates an unprecedented and underexplored opportunity for investors.Gender Lens Investing, co-authored by Jackie VanderBrug, Managing Director and Joseph Quinlan, Managing Director and Chief Market Strategist, of U.S. Trust, Bank of America Private Wealth Management, is the first book of its kind to examine, in-depth the advantages of integrating gender into investment analysis. While other books speak to growing numbers and influence of women, Gender Lens Investing moves from economic trends to financial strategy.Learn why gender is material to economic prosperity and investment performanceExplore ways to use a gender lens to assess products, companies and sectors.Delve into the forces of positive social change supported by a gender perspective on investment choicesExamine profitable and gratifying gender lens investment strategiesWomen are one of the world's greatest underutilized assets, and applying a gender lens allows you to identify companies that recognize this, or uncover the risks of companies that neglect it.

Tools, tips and strategies to stop the cycle of 'busy' and start getting aheadStand Out shows you how to stop working so much, and start achieving instead. Everyone is busy, but working harder to do more isn't getting us anywhere. We're overwhelmed, distracted and detached, and our greatest fear is that this will never change. This book is your guide to taking back your life. Through simple models, robust diagnostics and practical suggestions you'll identify where you are now and how to implement real change. Explore how to move on from Check Out (the sense that you are just going through the motions), combat Burn Out (the feeling that you're on a treadmill that is dialled too fast for your legs, brain and talents to keep pace with) and move through Freak Out (that overriding anxiety generated by knowing where you want to go but not getting any traction). Real-life stories, anecdotes and ‘life hacks' provide ideas you can implement immediately, while in-depth discussion of psychological theory explains the science behind the actions. The goal is not to find your One True Passion, but to identify what's most important right now. When you're clear on purpose and actually making progress, you hit the sweet spot of activity that allows your talents to shine. The concept of 'being at work' has changed. We're expected to be plugged in 24/7, and continually expected to do more and more with the same 24 hours in every day. Organisations suffer, families suffer and workers suffer – so why do we perpetuate this cycle? This book shows you how to hop off the hamster wheel and thrive through relentless change by doing less – but by doing it smarter. Treat self-care as an imperative for successConnect to what's important here and nowStop day-dreaming and put action to purposeTake control of your day, your path and your lifeIt's not about productivity training or the latest organisational system – it's about having the tools, mindset and skills in place to make your activities work for you. Stand Out helps you find the courage and optimism to live the life you crave, let go of the ‘shoulds' and shows you how to prioritise what really matters.

This is the Rough Cut edition of the printed book.
In Effective C#, Third
Edition, respected .NET expert Bill Wagner identifies 50
ways to harness the full power of the C# 6.0 language to write
exceptionally robust, efficient, and well-performing code.
Reflecting the growing sophistication of the C# language and its
development community, Wagner has identified dozens of new ways to
write better code. This edition’s new solutions include some
that take advantage of generics and several that are more focused
on LINQ, as well as a full chapter of advanced best practices for
working with exceptions.Wagner’s clear, practical
explanations, expert tips, and realistic code examples have made
Effective C# indispensable to hundreds of thousands of developers.
Drawing on his unsurpassed C# experience, he addresses everything
from resource management to multicore support, and reveals how to
avoid common pitfalls in the language and its .NET environment.
Learn how to choose the most effective solution when multiple
options exist, and how to write code that’s far easier to
maintain and improve. Wagner shows how and why toPrefer implicitly typed local variables (see Item 1)Replace string.Format() with interpolated strings (see Item
4)Express callbacks with delegates (see Item 7)Make the most of .NET resource management (see Item 11)Define minimal and sufficient constraints for generics(see Item

Trainingsbuch zum Fotografieren lernenKonkrete technische Hilfe für beeindruckende Landschaftsfotos Spannende Erfahrungsberichte des bekannten Bloggers und YouTubers Stephan Wiesner Viele Übungen für ein grundlegendes Verständnis von Bildaufbau, Verschlusszeit, ISO und Histogramm 
Eine teure Ausrüstung ist für tolle Landschaftsaufnahmen nicht nötig, aber grundlegende Kenntnisse zu den Kameraeinstellungen und der Bildkomposition ermöglichen jedem Hobbyfotografen, in der Natur zu optimalen Fotoergebnissen zu kommen. Leicht verständlich und stark motivierend berichtet der Blogger und YouTuber Stephan Wiesner von den Erfahrungen bei seinen kleineren und größeren Fotoexpeditionen und zeigt anhand wundervoller Fotos, worauf es – nicht nur technisch – ankommt. Wer sich zuvor mit ISO und Histogramm geplagt hat, wird nun endlich das Handwerkzeug verstehen und anhand vieler kleiner »Hausaufgaben« mehr Routine bekommen. Die Tücken typischer Motive wie Sonnenaufgang, Wasser, Wolken und Schnee beleuchtet Stephan Wiesner ebenso wie unvorhergesehene Probleme der verschiedenen Wetterlagen oder mit der Ausrüstung. Nicht zuletzt weckt der sehr persönliche Einblick in die Naturfotografen-Szene die Lust, sich direkt selbst mit seinem Fotorucksack auf den Weg zu schönen Naturmotiven zu machen.

Rothaermel, Ha Hoang</strong></li><li>Topic: <strong>Leadership</strong></li><li>ISBN: <strong>53863MIT58119/</strong></li><li>Publisher: <strong>MIT Sloan Management Review</strong></li></ul>
Two key strategic alliances were crucial to the early success of Tesla Motors Inc. A partnership with Daimler AG provided a much-needed cash injection; a partnership with Toyota Motor Corp. gave Tesla access to a world-class automobile manufacturing facility located near its headquarters in Palo Alto, California. In 2014, Tesla Motors signed yet another strategic alliance -- this one with Panasonic Corp., a world leader in battery technology.

The alliances highlight the fact that companies may not need to own all of the resources, skills, and knowledge necessary to undertake key strategic growth initiatives. When conditions are uncertain and the stakes are high, partnerships can be an attractive alternative to going it alone or to mergers and acquisitions. Accordingly, many companies now maintain alliance portfolios. As a result, executives must manage multiple alliances with diverse partners across the globe simultaneously. However, the skills required to develop and manage alliances are still not well understood. In this article, the authors attempt to address these shortcomings by offering an integrative and holistic framework of alliance management along with practical guidance.

Although strategic alliances are often viewed as a critical tool for pursuing growth opportunities, recent survey data suggest that roughly half of alliance portfolios underperform. Although the assessments of performance are subjective, it is fair to say that many alliances fail to live up to expectations. Why? As the authors found in their research, companies move at different rates down the learning curve related to managing alliances. Smaller companies may have advantages in this relative to larger partners because they are usually less complex internally and have stronger incentives to learn. Moreover, the benefits of alliance experience depend on the extent to which the organization can actively capture and leverage its experience (for instance, one partner may be able to draw additional benefits from an alliance, while the other may continue to make the same old mistakes). Hence, the authors argue, companies need to take a holistic and strategic approach. Tesla, for instance, doesn&#8217;t view its alliances as individual deals but as part of an overall strategy to establish a new standard in automotive technology and, along the way, to gain a competitive advantage.

Much prior research on alliance management has tended to focus on one aspect of the process -- for example, how to manage a stand-alone alliance. The authors note that executives often need to manage multiple alliances at once with partners in different geographies and at different stages of the alliance life cycle. Using the experience of Lego A/S as an illustration, the authors present a process framework with five distinct steps (partner selection, deal negotiation, execution, exit, and portfolio management). In addition, they offer a set of critical questions that can help executives undertake and manage alliances more effectively.

Learn how to create good requirements when designing hardware and software systems. While this book emphasizes writing traditional “shall” statements, it also provides guidance on use case design and creating user stories in support of agile methodologies. The book surveys modeling techniques and various tools that support requirements collection and analysis. You’ll learn to manage requirements, including discussions of document types and digital approaches using spreadsheets, generic databases, and dedicated requirements tools. Good, clear examples are presented, many related to real-world work the author has done during his career.Requirements Writing for System Engineeringantages of different requirements approaches and implement them correctly as your needs evolve. Unlike most requirements books. Requirements Writing for System Engineeringteaches writing both hardware and software requirements because many projects include both areas. To exemplify this approach, two example projects are developed throughout the book, one focusing on hardware and the other on software.This bookPresents many techniques for capturing requirements.Demonstrates gap analysis to find missing requirements.Shows how to address both software and hardware, as most projects involve both.Provides extensive examples of “shall” statements, user stories, and use cases.Explains how to supplement or replace traditional requirement statements with user stories and use cases that work well in agile development environments.

Process Manager (BPM) platform that enables custom user interfaces
to be easily embedded within business process solutions. Developer
tools enable process authors to rapidly create a compelling user
experience (UI) that can be delivered to desktop and mobile
devices. IBM Process Portal, used by business operations to access,
execute, and manage tasks, is entirely coach-based and can easily
be configured and styled. A corporate look and feel can be defined
using a graphical theme editor and applied consistently across all
process applications. The process federation capability enables
business users to access and execute all their tasks using a single
UI without being aware of the implementation or origin. Using Coach
Framework, you can embed coach-based UI in other web applications,
develop BPM UI using alternative UI technology, and create mobile
applications for off-line working.This IBM Redbooks® publication explains how to fully
benefit from the power of the Coach Framework. It focuses on the
capabilities that Coach Framework delivers with IBM BPM version
8.5.7. The content of this document, though, is also pertinent to

Transition AngularJS applications effectively and elegantly to Angular 2 About This VideoMigrate an application built with Angular 1.x to Angular 2Learn about the major syntactical and conceptual changes of Angular 2Future proof migrated applications with best practices prescribed by the Angular teamIn DetailAngular 2 is a technical and conceptual overhaul of its hugely popular predecessor, AngularJS. This means that for developers who have built and maintained applications with AngularJS, and need to transition projects across to Angular 2, there needs to be an effective plan of action. Implementing a migration path for projects has been a major talking point in itself leading up to the release of Angular 2, and a critical concern for developer teams transitioning code across to take advantage of the new framework. Angular is a complete solution for rapid front-end development. No other plugins or frameworks are necessary to build a data-driven web application.This course demonstrates how to apply an effective migration plan for transitioning Angular 1.x projects to Angular 2. Opening with an introduction to the major changes and additions brought by the new framework, we quickly scope out a plan to a migrate a sample weather application from its original Angular 1.x code base.We then explain how to migrate blocks of code incrementally, as opposed to porting code in bulk, and give you a brief introduction to Typescript and ECMAScript 6. Throughout we’ll show you how to gradually deprecate $scope, upgrade services, work with the component router, transition forms, and more.By completion of this course, you will be rapidly up to speed with the fundamental building blocks of Angular 2 development, and fully capable (and confident) transitioning existing Angular 1.x projects to the new environment, ready to explore everything the new Angular has to offer.

Business users and analysts want quick, practical knowledge. Regarding SQL and database topics, they are more interested in how to use data rather than create it (this means the SELECT statement is highly relevant to them). As they progress they will likely want to know how to create their own databases, but only to a certain extent. The business logic of database design is likely what they are interested in. They may want to understand basic table design principles and a high-level understanding of normalization. But security, administration, data theory, and other DBA/engineering tasks will likely not be relevant to them. Typically when business users prototype a database for their business needs, they might hand it off to a DBA to put in production if it is deemed critical for the business.

This is the Rough Cut version of the printed
book.Today, companies know they must adapt
quickly or die. They are increasingly seeking to adapt by using
agile principles and practices—but many are still changing
too slowly, and can't sustain change. Fortunately, a growing number
of enterprises have found a far more effective solution: the Scaled
Agile Framework (SAFe).SAFe changes the game by integrating Agile,
Lean and product development flow thinking with a new operating
model that successfully coordinate works at all levels: team,
program, and portfolio. SAFe helps managers learn to become
lean-thinking leaders, working with teams to continuously improve
their systems, and create environments where everyone flourishes.
In SAFe(R) 4.0 Distilled, two SAFe
pioneers show software practitioners how to use achieve higher
productivity, improve the quality of their software processes, and
bridge the divide between executives, managers and
practitioners—aligning everyone towards common goals and
objectives. If you want to scale and sustain agile in the
enterprise, SAFe can get you there. SAFe(R) 4.0
Distilled will help you launch it, quickly earn value from
it, and grow its value with every new project.

In this lesson, you’ll learn how to design data models for Cassandra, including a data modeling process and notation. To apply this knowledge, we’ll design the data model for a sample application. This will help show how all the parts fit together. Along the way, we’ll use a tool to help us manage our CQL (Cassandra Query Language) scripts.What you’ll learn—and how you can apply itYou will learn common patterns and antipatterns for data modeling in Cassandra.  This lesson will cover the concepts around data modeling and will compare a Cassandra data model with an equivalent relational database model. You’ll learn about defining queries and about logical and physical database modeling. You’ll learn how to optimize your model for performance, and finally you’ll learn how to implement your model schema using CQL.This lesson is for you because…You are an application developer or architect who wants to learn how data is stored and processed in Cassandra.You are a database administrator who wants to learn about Cassandra.PrerequisitesHelpful but not essential to have a basic understanding of relational vs. distributed databases.Helpful but not essential to understand Cassandra Query Language, CQL.Materials or downloads needed in advanceNone

In this lesson, we look at how to tune Cassandra to improve performance. There are a variety of settings in the configuration file and on individual tables. Although the default settings are appropriate for many use cases, there might be circumstances in which you need to change them. We’ll look at how and why to make these changes.We also see how to use the cassandra-stress test tool that ships with Cassandra to generate load against Cassandra and quickly see how it behaves under stress test circumstances. We can then tune Cassandra appropriately and feel confident that we’re ready to deploy to a production environment.What you’ll learn—and how you can apply itYou’ll learn how to monitor and analyze Cassandra performance. You’ll learn about Cassandra features such as caching, memtables, commit logs, SStables, hinted handoff, compaction, and threading to improve responsiveness, consistency, and speed and reduce data loss. We’ll also look at timeout properties and JVM settings.This lesson is for you because…You are a developer, database administrator, or architect who wants to learn how to tune Cassandra.PrerequisitesUnderstanding of Cassandra architecture and data model.If you want to run cassandra-stress Cassandra installed with a running Cassandra cluster.Materials or downloads neededA Cassandra cluster if you want to run cassandra-stress

The perimeter defenses guarding your network perhaps are not as secure as you think. Hosts behind the firewall have no defenses of their own, so when a host in the "trusted" zone is breached, access to your data center is not far behind. That’s an all-too-familiar scenario today. With this practical book, you’ll learn the principles behind zero trust architecture, along with details necessary to implement it.

The International Journal of Systems and Society (IJSS) is dedicated to support and encourage the publication of high quality articles that promote the way in which systems ideas are used. Papers are encouraged from practitioners, systems researchers, and systems academics. The focus of the journal is on the use and development of systems ideas within society and less on literature reviews, although some instances may occur where such papers are accepted. The journal encourages field research and research into real situations. All papers undergo a double blind peer review process and the difference in style of practitioner papers from academic is acknowledged. In the long tradition of the Systemist, opinion papers are considered for publication at the discretion of the Editor-in-Chief.This issue contains the following articles:Analysing Online Social Networks from a Soft Systems PerspectivePursuit of Operational Excellence: A Systemic ApproachA Managerial and Linguistic Perspective on Researching Manager Behaviour Aimed at Replacing Human Managers with RobotsThe Systems Forum: What Value Have Systems Ideas in Making Sense of The Complexity of Issues Like Migration?

Educational technologies are vastly becoming a common-place entity in classrooms as they provide more options and support for teachers and students. However, many teachers are finding these technologies difficult to use as they were never fully trained on how to utilize it or have received little instruction on how to effectively apply it in the classroom. Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) Framework for K-12 Teacher Preparation: Emerging Research and Opportunities features contemporary insights into a multi-year research effort that concluded with the design and development of an online TPACK learning trajectory. Highlighting how this development impacts the design of professional development coursework for educators, this publication is a critical work for in-service teachers, researchers, and online course developers.

Rugged Embedded Systems: Computing in Harsh Environments describes how to design reliable embedded systems for harsh environments, including architectural approaches, cross-stack hardware/software techniques, and emerging challenges and opportunities. A "harsh environment" presents inherent characteristics, such as extreme temperature and radiation levels, very low power and energy budgets, strict fault tolerance and security constraints, etc. that challenge the computer system in its design and operation. To guarantee proper execution (correct, safe, and low-power) in such scenarios, this contributed work discusses multiple layers that involve firmware, operating systems, and applications, as well as power management units and communication interfaces. This book also incorporates use cases in the domains of unmanned vehicles (advanced cars and micro aerial robots) and space exploration as examples of computing designs for harsh environments.Provides a deep understanding of embedded systems for harsh environments by experts involved in state-of-the-art autonomous vehicle-related projectsCovers the most important challenges (fault tolerance, power efficiency, and cost effectiveness) faced when developing rugged embedded systemsIncludes case studies exploring embedded computing for autonomous vehicle systems (advanced cars and micro aerial robots) and space exploration

Create a more robust service management system using the best of ITIL&#174;, ISO/IEC 20000-1, COBIT&#174;, and CMMI&#174;-SVC.

Although ITIL&#8217;s popularity as a framework for IT service management (ITSM) continues to increase, a number of organizations have realized that its approach is sometimes not quite enough on its own. Many are already working towards compliance with ISO/IEC 20000-1 &#8212; the international standard for ITSM &#8212; but, with the likes of COBIT 5 and CMMI-SVC to consider as well, it can be difficult to determine the best route to take.

Until now, there has been little guidance on how to merge these frameworks in order to produce a robust enterprise philosophy for service delivery. Pragmatic Application of Service Management &#8211; The Five Anchor Approach provides that guidance.

 

Product overview

Completely updated by service management gurus Suzanne D. Van Hove and Mark Thomas, the second edition of Pragmatic Application of Service Management &#8211; The Five Anchor Approach provides comprehensive guidance on creating an integrated system based on COBIT 5, ISO 20000, ITIL, and CMMI-SVC. This practical book enables service managers to immediately adapt and deploy the guidance, and quickly improve their ITSM function.

It now features a short chapter on applying the &#8216;five anchors&#8217; approach to integrating service management frameworks in very small enterprises (VSEs), and contains four new &#8216;caselets&#8217; (short case studies).

Packed with instructive illustrations, helpful tables,  and the authors&#8217; very own five anchor approach, this book is ideal for anyone considering adopting, adapting, or merging COBIT5, ISO/IEC 20000, ITIL,  and CMMI-SVC.

 

Better ITSM through integrated best practice

Written by service management gurus Suzanne D. Van Hove and Mark Thomas, Pragmatic Application of Service Management &#8211; The Five Anchors Approach presents a holistic view of service management, and provides a unique mapping to assist service management practitioners in their information gathering.

For decades, alarms have sounded about declining engagement. Yet companies continue to struggle with toxic cultures, and the low productivity and unhappiness that go with them.Why is “culture” so difficult to improve? What makes so many good employees check out? Neuroscientist Paul Zak shows that innate brain functions hold the answers. It all boils down to trust.When someone shows you trust, a feel-good jolt of oxytocin surges through your brain and triggers you to reciprocate. This simple mechanism creates a perpetual trust-building cycle—the key to changing stubborn workplace patterns.Drawing on his original research, Zak teases out science-backed insights for building high-trust organizations. Trust Factor opens a window on how brain chemicals affect behavior, why trust gets squashed, and ways to consciously stimulate it by celebrating effort, sharing information, promoting ownership, and more. The Ofactor™ survey, data, and examples support the action plans.Engagement programs and monetary rewards are Band-Aids on broken bones. To get to the root of the problem, you’ve got to go deeper. Packed with examples from The Container Store, Zappos, and Herman Miller, Trust Factor harnesses our neurochemistry to effectively cultivate work places where trust, joy, and commitment compound naturally.

AN AMAZING NEW VERSION OF THE
PHOTOSHOP BOOK THAT BREAKS ALL THE RULES!Scott Kelby, Editor and Publisher
of Photoshop User magazine–and the
best-selling photography techniques author in the world
today–once again takes this book to a whole new level as he
uncovers more of the latest, most important, and most useful Adobe
Photoshop techniques for photographers.This update to his award-winning,
record-breaking book does something for digital photographers
that’s never been done before–it cuts through the bull
and shows you exactly “how to do it.” It’s not a
bunch of theory; it doesn’t challenge you to come up with
your own settings or figure it out on your own. Instead, Scott
shows you step by step the exact techniques used by today’s
cutting-edge digital photographers, and best of all, he shows
you flat-out exactly which settings to use, when to use
them, and why.LEARN HOW THE PROS DO ITThe photographer’s workflow in
Photoshop has evolved greatly over time, and in this current
version of book you’ll wind up doing
a lot of your processing and editing in
Photoshop’s Adobe Camera Raw feature (whether you shoot in
RAW, JPEG or TIFF–it works for all three). That’s
because for years now, Adobe has been adding most of
Photoshop’s new features for photography directly into Camera
Raw itself. Since today’s photography workflow in Photoshop
is based around Camera Raw, about one third of this book is about
mastering Camera Raw like a pro. Plus, you’ll learn:• The sharpening techniques the
pros really use.• The pros’ tricks for
fixing the most common digital photo problems fast!• The most useful retouching
techniques for photographers, and how to make
“impossible” selections like wind-blown hair
(it’s easy, once you know the secrets), and how to use Layers
like a pro.  • How to seamlessly remove
distracting junk from your images.• How to stitch panoramas, how
to process HDR for a realistic look, and tricks for pulling way
more out of your images than you ever dreamed possible.• The latest Photoshop special
effects for photographers (there’s a whole chapter just
on these!).• A host of shortcuts,
workarounds, and slick “insider” tricks to send
your productivity through the roof!Scott includes a special chapter with his
own workflow, from start to finish, plus, each chapter ends
with a Photoshop Killer Tips section, packed with time-saving,
job-saving tips that make all the difference. He also provides four
bonus chapters, along with the images used in the book for download
so you can follow right along. If you’re ready to
learn all the “tricks of the trade”–the same
ones that today’s leading pros use to correct, edit, retouch,
and sharpen their work–then you’re holding the book
that will do just that.

For decades researchers and programmers have used SAS to analyze, summarize, and report clinical trial data. Now Chris Holland and Jack Shostak have updated their popular Implementing CDISC Using SAS, the first comprehensive book on applying clinical research data and metadata to the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC) standards.

Implementing CDISC Using SAS: An End-to-End Guide, Second Edition, is an all-inclusive guide on how to implement and analyze the Study Data Tabulation Model (SDTM) and the Analysis Data Model (ADaM) data and prepare clinical trial data for regulatory submission. Updated to reflect the 2017 FDA mandate for adherence to CDISC standards, this new edition covers creating and using metadata, developing conversion specifications, implementing and validating SDTM and ADaM data, determining solutions for legacy data conversions, and preparing data for regulatory submission. The book covers products such as Base SAS, SAS Clinical Data Integration, and the SAS Clinical Standards Toolkit, as well as JMP Clinical. Topics included in this new edition include an implementation of the Define-XML 2.0 standard, new SDTM domains, validation with Pinnacle 21 software, event narratives in JMP Clinical, and of course new versions of SAS and JMP software.

Any manager or user of clinical trial data in this day and age is likely to benefit from knowing how to either put data into a CDISC standard or analyzing and finding data once it is in a CDISC format. If you are one such person--a data manager, clinical and/or statistical programmer, biostatistician, or even a clinician--then this book is for you.

This book addresses gaps in current project management literature.  From a senior management perspective, the gap is the lack of resources explaining why and how to establish a program to improve executive sponsorship strategically across an organization.  From a tactical perspective, the gap is a scarcity of actionable materials to clarify roles, responsibilities, expected behaviors, and identify support necessary for improving sponsor effectiveness.  Improving Executive Sponsorship of Projects identifies key factors to consider before creating an executive sponsorship improvement program or enhancing an existing one. The authors explain why executive sponsorship is important to an organization, how an organization&#8217;s culture influences the effectiveness of the sponsor role, and why project management standards are critical to success.  The book explores what roles, responsibilities, and behavior should be considered and how to determine whether the person in the sponsor role is the right person and prepared to do the job. Finally, it provides a process and tools to assess an organization&#8217;s readiness to implement an executive sponsorship program, develop a plan for improvement, and monitor the progress of a program once it has begun.

But, on other hand, huge unemployment created from reduction of workforce due to automa&#194;tion, has reduced the consumer purchasing power and is indirectly hurting the Return on Investments (RoI). This brings any further progress of technology to a standstill. For technology to progress both supply and demand have to grow. The supply comes from produc&#194;tivity of workforce and demand comes from their wages. Hence, free markets must ensure that wages  automatically catch up with ever-growing productivity, with minimal government in&#194;tervention. To avoid automation from destroying jobs in an economy, free markets should ensure that working hours of workforce be reduced during the waning phase of economy and increased during its waxing phase.

This second volume of Critical Thinking for Marketers expands your background knowledge of other areas of critical thinking that are making major contributions to both marketing as a social science and marketing as an applied science.  Section I, Think Better, provides introductory discussions of - marketing as a science; the difference between correlation and causation; the meaning of what a &#8220;concept&#8221; is and why it is critical for marketers to develop good concept definitions (e.g., &#8220;What is customer satisfaction?&#8221;); why the 18th century Scottish philosopher David Hume is relevant to marketers today; and the impact that behavioral economics is having on how marketers do their job. Section II, Cognitive Biases and Their Importance, talks about recent discoveries in cognitive psychology and neuroscience that have relevance to marketers.  You&#8217;ll learn that marketers need to be aware of their own cognitive biases and irrational thinking processes, which often lead to making bad decisions, and that the retail and business customers we market to are not as rational as we may think and hope they are. Finally, Section III, Conclusions, draws on both Volumes I and II to summarize the book&#8217;s primary messages with helpful hints on applying your new tools and making better marketing decisions.

Gerd Ludwig, a National Geographic veteran known for his powerful photo essays, is one of the leading documentary photographers of our time. As a photographer focusing on diverse cultural and environmental stories, Ludwig is often confronted with a wide range of low-light situations—from classic street photography to portraiture, from scenes in bustling night clubs to intimate moments in churches—many of which require additional lighting that must be created quickly, effectively, and discreetly.More than 20 years ago, Ludwig began incorporating small handheld flashes into his photography with the aim of creating an evenly balanced look in the final photograph. These small flashes also alleviated the burden of carrying heavy equipment, allowing him to be flexible and inconspicuous when moving around in the field. Over the years, he has refined his use of small flash to hone his technique even further. His use of flash appears so subtle in the final image that it is easily mistaken for natural light—an invisible flash. Additionally, in his fine-art and documentary work in interior or night settings, Ludwig recently began making long exposures by combining a camera on a tripod with a series of flashes fired from a single hand-held unit.In the past, Ludwig has discussed his tricks of the trade only in lectures and workshops. Now, in Minus 2/3—The Invisible Flash: Crafting Light for Photographers in Field, Ludwig takes us behind the scenes of many of his most iconic images to share his approach to lighting with small flash. Equal parts inspiration and education, Minus 2/3 is straightforward and succinct, yet filled with numerous takeaways from one of today’s leading photographers. Packed with beautiful, effective, and moving images, Minus 2/3 offers ideas, insight, and inspiration for photographers looking to subtly incorporate flash into their work.Please note: Some images featured in this book may be considered unsettling for some sensitive readers.

A Beautiful Anarchy is a vulnerable, honest, and insightful book about the human longing to create, whether you’re creating a family, a business, a book, or a photograph. Your greatest creation can be an intentional life lived on your own terms. What is our life but a chance to make the greatest art of all?If you already identify as a creative person, this book is an invitation to more intentionally explore your creative process. If you've ever said, “But I’m not really creative,” it’s a call to exhume a part of yourself that desperately needs to get out and breathe. This is an honest discussion about creativity and the obstacles that stand in your way on that journey. It’s an invitation to consider the creative in all of us, and to recognize that your best work will always be done when you colour outside the lines and listen first to your own voice. Truly exceptional, authentic lives have never belonged to the talented or the fearless, but to those who find the courage to do their work, and to be themselves.

Building on the success of the 2007 original, Dekker revises, enhances and expands his view of just culture for this second edition, additionally tackling the key issue of how justice is created inside organizations. The goal remains the same: to create an environment where learning and accountability are fairly and constructively balanced.  The First Edition of Sidney Dekker&#8217;s Just Culture brought accident accountability and criminalization to a broader audience. It made people question, perhaps for the first time, the nature of personal culpability when organizational accidents occur.  Having raised this awareness the author then discovered that while many organizations saw the fairness and value of creating a just culture they really struggled when it came to developing it: What should they do? How should they and their managers respond to incidents, errors, failures that happen on their watch?  In this Second Edition, Dekker expands his view of just culture, additionally tackling the key issue of how justice is created inside organizations. The new book is structured quite differently. Chapter One asks, &#8217;what is the right thing to do?&#8217; - the basic moral question underpinning the issue. Ensuing chapters demonstrate how determining the &#8217;right thing&#8217; really depends on one&#8217;s viewpoint, and that there is not one &#8217;true story&#8217; but several. This naturally leads into the key issue of how justice is established inside organizations and the practical efforts needed to sustain it. The following chapters place just culture and criminalization in a societal context. Finally, the author reflects upon why we tend to blame individual people for systemic failures when in fact we bear collective responsibility.  The changes to the text allow the author to explain the core elements of a just culture which he delineated so successfully in the First Edition and to explain how his original ideas have evolved. Dekker also introduces new material on ethics and on caring

This is a live recording of Bill Inmon from Data Modeling Zone 2016 (www.DataModelingZone.com).
Professionals have long recognized the need for abstraction of data. And the world of unstructured data is no different. But abstraction of data in the unstructured world takes a different form - taxonomies and ontologies. 
This session is an introduction to taxonomies and ontologies and how they apply to the world of unstructured data.

For those interested in delving deeper into the Julia language, for data science projects, this video offers a comprehensive introduction to the key aspects of it. Without making any assumptions about your programming background (apart from just the one, that you have some programming experience), we look into the characteristics of the language that make it what it is, and how they can facilitate your data science process, should you incorporate Julia in it. Namely, we look into functional programming, multiple dispatch, Julia’s user defined types, and the basics of parallelism. Upon watching this video, you’ll feel more confident about this powerful tool, and more empowered to work the data using it, like never before!We will cover:
 What is Julia anyway? This includes the early years of Julia, Julia’s current state, the future of Julia language, and Julia’s role in the programming world.
 How Julia fits in the Data Science process
 Functional programming
 Multiple dispatch
 Julia’s user defined types
 Parallelism basics in Julia
 Next steps including what’s next in the Julia universe, what you can do once you get the hang of Julia, and resources for further development

For over twenty years, digitisation has been a core element of the modern information landscape. The digital lifecycle is now well defined, and standards and good practice have been developed for most of its key stages. There remains, however, a widespread lack of coordination of digitisation initiatives, both within and across different sectors, and there are disparate approaches to selection criteria. The result is ‘silos’ of digitised content.  Stepping away from the Silos examines the strategic context in the UK since the 1990s and its effect on collaboration and coordination of exemplar digitisation initiatives in higher education and related sectors. It identifies the principal criteria for content selection that are common to the international literature in this field. The outputs of the exemplar projects are examined in relation to these criteria. A range of common practices and patterns in content selection appears to have developed over time, forming a de facto strategy from which several areas of critical mass have emerged. The book discusses the potential to improve strategic collaboration and coordinated selection by building on such a platform, and considers planning options in the context of work on national digitisation strategies in the UK and internationally. Summarises the rise of publicly funded digitisation in the UK from the 1990s to date and identifies the need to improve coordination and content selection criteriaReviews the role of digitisation in government and organisational strategies from the 1990s to the present dayExamines the strategic position of collaboration within and across different organisationsIdentifies common selection criteria and outlines the coverage of exemplar projects  Discusses the apparent emergence of a de facto selection strategy and the potential for national strategic planning of digitised content based on existing  outputs and improved collaboration

A key component of data science is statistics and machine learning, but only a small proportion of data scientists are actually trained as statisticians. This concise guide illustrates how to apply statistical concepts essential to data science, with advice on how to avoid their misuse.Many courses and books teach basic statistics, but rarely from a data science perspective. And while many data science resources incorporate statistical methods, they typically lack a deep statistical perspective. This quick reference book bridges that gap in an accessible, readable format.
