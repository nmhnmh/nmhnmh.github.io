“This is one of the most unique and valuable books you will read all year, and I highly recommend it.”—Jim Kouzes, coauthor of the bestselling and award-winning The Leadership Challenge and Dean's Executive Fellow of Leadership, Leavey School of Business, Santa Clara UniversityEven the best leaders—in fact, most of the best leaders—start out as decidedly bad ones. And sooner or later they reach a moment of reckoning that leadership expert Bill Treasurer calls the leadership kick in the ass. When it happens, it feels like it's all over. But Treasurer says that with the right attitude, that kick can be a new beginning. Based on his work with thousands of leaders, this book reveals how to turn those ego-bruising events into the kind of transformative experiences that mark the paths of great leaders. As Steve Jobs famously said, “Getting fired was the best thing that ever happened to me.” This book is a survival guide, coach, and morale booster to help you use that kick to move forward instead of fall down. If you succeed, the next place you get kicked might be upstairs.

Cooking up a New Library offers ways to make your library group space into one conducive to transformational learning. Transformational spaces are environments where safety reigns, where special kinds of relationships are built, while freedom and challenge remain central. Libraries must provide all these layers. A final layer of fun provides the icing on the library cake, helping the patron invest in learning.  This book provides librarians with ideas for providing a transformative library experience for their patrons. Some activities would appeal to a user engagement librarian or outreach librarian. An example of such an idea is the ‘Edible Book Festival,’ where participants create an edible representation of a book. Submissions can then be judged on a number of different merits. Some, such as the ‘Personal Librarian’, would appeal to subject liaisons and instruction librarians. Still others are easy and inexpensive activities where librarians who manage Information Commons areas or Circulation departments, would find value.The book is structured as cookbook with an introduction to the idea, then directions on its execution. Following directions, the book gives tips on how to adapt each ‘recipe’ to fit other specific needs, including other kinds of libraries. The layout will follow three strands: space, community, and outreach. Each of the sections will include five elements critical to transforming spaces: fun, stimulation, safety, freedom, and personal. Each section will contain an introduction, demonstrating why this idea is important. Following that will be a selection of recipes of ways to introduce that element to the space in question. From providing coffee in the morning, to a full Personal Librarian program, this book presents useful and engaging ideas for transformational learning. Provides practical ideas to enable and encourage transformational learning in academic and research librariesPresents practical ideas in the style of a cookbook; recipes that can be readily applied to a variety of sites and situationsGives useful insight and ideas relevant to different kinds of libraries, including academic and research librariesSuggests fun, quirky, and practical ideas for your library

Transliteracy in Complex Information Environments considers this relatively new concept, which has attracted a great deal of interest in the library and  information field, particularly among practitioners. The notion of transliteracy arises in the context of increasingly complex information and communication environments characterised by multimodality and new roles of creators and consumers. Transliteracy concerns the ability to apply and transfer a range of skills and contextual insights to a variety of settings. Rather than focusing on any one skillset or technology, transliteracy is about fluidity of movement across a range of contexts. This book is concerned with processes of learning and knowledge creation. An understanding of transliteracy emergesfrom research data gathered in university and high school settings. Transliteracy is considered in relation to other literacies as an overarching framework. Applications in education and lifelong learning are discussed. Social aspects of transliteracy are considered in relation to academic cultures and broader social trends, particularly hybrid culturesProvides an overarching model of transliteracy based on the well-established information literacyRelates to a number of professional and academic fields, such as library and information, education, communication, media, and cultural studiesIntegrates both professional and academic perspectives

Global market sizes for nanocoatings and coatings are expected to be $14.3 billion and $123 billion, respectively, by the year 2019. Coatings can be classified according to their applications or method of preparation or type of property imparted to the product. They can be either solvent based or water based and may be comprised of polymers or inorganic materials. Nanocoatings with thicknesses less than 100 nm can offer superior performance properties compared with conventional coatings. Nanotuff was one of the first commercial nanocoatings it contained nanosized particles suspended in an epoxy matrix. Coatings can have specific purposes such as corrosion resistance, antiabrasive resistance, scratch resistance, chemical resistance, and stain resistance to the objects they are applied on. This book contains some new theory in the areas of solubility parameter estimates using isentropic volume expansivity, compressibility, and surface tension effects during coating flows.

Temporal Data Mining via Unsupervised Ensemble Learning provides the principle knowledge of temporal data mining in association with unsupervised ensemble learning and the fundamental problems of temporal data clustering from different perspectives. By providing three proposed ensemble approaches of temporal data clustering, this book presents a practical focus of fundamental knowledge and techniques, along with a rich blend of theory and practice. Furthermore, the book includes illustrations of the proposed approaches based on data and simulation experiments to demonstrate all methodologies, and is a guide to the proper usage of these methods. As there is nothing universal that can solve all problems, it is important to understand the characteristics of both clustering algorithms and the target temporal data so the correct approach can be selected for a given clustering problem. Scientists, researchers, and data analysts working with machine learning and data mining will benefit from this innovative book, as will undergraduate and graduate students following courses in computer science, engineering, and statistics.Includes fundamental concepts and knowledge, covering all key tasks and techniques of temporal data mining, i.e., temporal data representations, similarity measure, and mining tasksConcentrates on temporal data clustering tasks from different perspectives, including major algorithms from clustering algorithms and ensemble learning approachesPresents a rich blend of theory and practice, addressing seminal research ideas and looking at the technology from a practical point-of-view

The nutrition of an individual during gestation and the first two years of life—the first 1,000 days—sets the stage for lifelong health. Nutrition quality and quantity in this period can influence the risk of developing diseases that constitute today’s epidemics. Early-life nutrition can program the body’s tissues, organ structure and function, and metabolic and immunologic responses. These factors impact growth, development and cognition, and the risk of cardiovascular diseases, allergies and obesity. The first part of Early Nutrition and Long-Term Health examines the mechanisms by which early nutrition affects the risk of developing these conditions. The second part of this book reviews specific non-communicable diseases (NCDs) associated with early nutrition. The third part discusses the effects of nutritional programming from fetal life to toddlerhood. Prevention of over- or undernutrition in early life, rather than dietary, behavioral or therapeutic interventions in later life, is likely to have a greater return on society’s investment in coping with the modern epidemic of NCDs.Examines the relation between early life nutrition and long-term healthCovers the mechanistic aspects of nutritional programming and its impact on risk of chronic non-communicable diseasesReviews associations between infant and child diet and its effect on growth, development, cognition and later occurrence of cardiovascular diseases, allergies, metabolic conditions and obesity

It's deja vu all over again. In the old days (35 plus years ago), developers wanting to write half-decent programs had to know their hardware. Those days are back. Clock frequencies have peaked and hardware can no longer be abstracted behind high-level languages. Designed for developers with high performance requirements (games, finance analysis, scientific computation, etc.), this course teaches you what really happens when programs are executed and the subtle details that make a program go slow or fast.With a focus on concurrency, specifically local concurrency (multi-threading), the course is all about writing efficient programs that make the best use of the computing resources available to you. While the sample code is written in C++, the course is not C++ specific. If you can read C++ code, but don’t use it in your work, you will still learn from this class.

Lately there has been a lot of talk on Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) and how it is very important for data science. However, many people still confuse the two and often cannot discern between Machine Learning (which is part of Data Science) and A.I. Naturally, things are not so clear-cut, which is why there is this confusion. In this video we explore the two fields, their intersection, and how learning about them can benefit you, in your data analytics endeavors.
We will answer these five questions:What is Data Science?
What is A.I.?
How Does DS incorporate A.I. these days?

avoid common pitfalls in the language and its .NET environment.
Learn how to choose the most effective solution when multiple
options exist, and how to write code that’s far easier to
maintain and improve. Wagner shows how and why toPrefer implicitly typed local variables (see Item 1)Replace string.Format() with interpolated strings (see Item
4)Express callbacks with delegates (see Item 7)Make the most of .NET resource management (see Item 11)Define minimal and sufficient constraints for generics (see
Item 18)Specialize generic algorithms using runtime type checking (see
Item 19)Use delegates to define method constraints on type parameters
(see Item 23)Augment minimal interface contracts with extension methods (see
Item 27)Create composable APIs for sequences (see Item 31)Decouple iterations from actions, predicates, and functions
(see Item 32)Prefer lambda expressions to methods (see Item 38)Distinguish early from deferred execution (see Item 40)Avoid capturing expensive resources (see Item 41)Use exceptions to report method contract failures (see Item

Leverage the small but powerfully-formed Flask framework and its extensibility About This VideoGet an in-depth look at the Python web micro-frameworkTake advantage of Flask’s extensibility to perform advanced web application developmentDevelop a real-world application using best practices to reduce its development and maintenance timeIn DetailFlask is a small and powerful web development framework for Python. It is called a micro-framework as it aims to keep the core simple but extensible. Even though it’s called a micro-framework, it is no way lacking in functionality, and allows you to develop applications very quickly, primarily through the development of a small codebase.This course will take you deep into the world of using Flask and its ecosystem of extensions to create web applications. We’ll walk through creating a simple IMDB clone from scratch. We’ll start by creating the boilerplate code and use Virtualenv to create an isolated development environment. You’ll then learn to work with the database using SQLAlchemy. After that, we’ll display our data to the end user using WTForms.We’ll restructure and modularize our code using Blueprints. Our site will be secured using the extensions Flask-Login and Flask-Principal. After that, we’ll create a RESTful API of our app. We’ll then give admin functionality and extend our app using various flask extensions. We’ll incorporate Celery to make our tasks asynchronous. We’ll walk you through performing unit test of our app, and then test our SQLAlchemy models. We’ll also test the URLs and finally, we’ll test how much of our code isn’t being tested. All these tests will make our app secure. Finally, we’ll deploy our Flask app to various options that are available.This course will give you an in-depth understanding of how to use Flask and its strong extensibility for more complex web applications.

Text summarization has been studied for over a half century, but traditional methods process texts empirically and neglect the fundamental characteristics and principles of language use and understanding. Automatic summarization is a desirable technique for processing big data. This reference summarizes previous text summarization approaches in a multi-dimensional category space, introduces a multi-dimensional methodology for research and development, unveils the basic characteristics and principles of language use and understanding, investigates some fundamental mechanisms of summarization, studies dimensions on representations, and proposes a multi-dimensional evaluation mechanism. Investigation extends to incorporating pictures into summary and to the summarization of videos, graphs and pictures, and converges to a general summarization method. Further, some basic behaviors of summarization are studied in the complex cyber-physical-social space. Finally, a creative summarization mechanism is proposed as an effort toward the creative summarization of things, which is an open process of interactions among physical objects, data, people, and systems in cyber-physical-social space through a multi-dimensional lens of semantic computing. The author’s insights can inspire research and development of many computing areas.The first book that proposes the method for the summarization of things in cyber-physical society through a multi-dimensional lens of semantic computing.A transformation from the traditional application-driven research paradigm into a data-driven research paradigm for creative summarization through information modeling, cognitive modeling and knowledge modeling.A multi-dimensional methodology for studying, managing, creating and applying methods.

This is the Rough Cut version of the printed book.Developers are increasingly being asked to
create software for Linux platforms. Many developers are accustomed
to creating software for Microsoft or other platforms, but don't
have experience with Linux environments or tools. While several
books cover Linux software development, Linux for Developers
is specifically designed to help these developers move to
Linux.Leading IT trainer/author William (Bo)
Rothwell first provides a clear and up-to-date introduction to the
complex world of open source software, including its licensing
arrangements and their associated tradeoffs. Next, Rothwell
introduces essential skills for both Linux command line and GUI
environments, emphasizing tools that developers need to create code
in Linux, including text editors.Building on this knowledge, he introduces
the primary languages used by Linux developers, from scripting
tools such as Bash, Python and Perl to traditional full-fledged
programming languages such as Java, C++, and C. Finally, Rothwell
presents a full section on the powerful Git version control system,
teaching skills that developers can use both in Linux and in many
other environments.This guide's modular coverage enables you to
quickly access the information you need to meet current challenges.
Appendices present one-page cheatsheets for each language, and for
the Linux commands developers need most often.

One of the most fundamental aspects of being able to use text for the purpose of decision making is that of being able to derive the context of text. Unstructured data does have context woven into its fabric. But the context must be “teased” out. Teasing out context is not a simple task because context exists in so many forms and structures. This course is about the work that must be done to unstructured data in order to reproduce it into a form that is suitable for analytical processing.
