There are many excellent R resources for visualization, data science, and package development. Hundreds of scattered vignettes, web pages, and forums explain how to use R in particular domains. But little has been written on how to simply make R work effectively—until now. This hands-on book teaches novices and experienced R users how to write efficient R code. Drawing on years of experience teaching R courses, authors Colin Gillespie and Robin Lovelace provide practical advice on a range of topics—from optimizing the set-up of RStudio to leveraging C++—that make this book a useful addition to any R user’s bookshelf.

 Approach the development process from a strategic viewpoint with the overall end result in mind. 
 Design screening experiments to identify components that are most important to the performance of the formulation. 
 Design optimization experiments to identify the maximum response in the design space. 
 Analyze both screening and optimization experiments using graphical and numerical methods. 
 Optimize multiple criteria, such as the quality, cost, and performance of product formulations. 
 Design and analyze formulation studies that involve both formulation components and process variables using methods that reduce the required experimentation by up to 50%. 
 
Linking dynamic graphics with powerful statistics, JMP helps construct a visually compelling narrative to interactively share findings that are coherent and actionable by colleagues and decision makers. Using this book, you can take advantage of computer generated experiment designs when classical designs do not suffice, given the physical and economic constraints of the experiential environment. 
Strategies for Formulations Development: A Step-by-Step Guide Using JMP(R) is unique because it provides formulation scientists with the essential information they need in order to successfully conduct formulation studies in the chemical, biotech, and pharmaceutical industries.

Weiss</strong></li><li>Topic: <strong>Accounting</strong></li><li>ISBN: <strong>9781631575143/</strong></li><li>Publisher: <strong>Business Expert Press</strong></li></ul>
Accounting is an economic information system, and can be thought of as the language of business. Accounting principles are created, developed, or decreed and are supported or justified by intuition, authority, and acceptability. Managers have alternatives in their accounting choices; the decision are political, and trade-offs will be made. Accounting information provides individuals, both inside and outside a firm, with a starting point to understand and evaluate the key drivers of a firm, its financial position, and performance. If you are managing a firm, investing in a firm, lending to a firm, or even working for a firm, you should be able to read the firm&#8217;s financial statements and ask questions based on those statements. This book examines some of the more advanced topics in accounting. As such, it assumes the reader already has some familiarity with basic accounting. (A related book covering the basics is Accounting for Fun and Profit: A Guide to Understanding Financial Statements.) The book explains how the user of financial statement should interpret advanced accounting techniques presented, and helps the user conduct in-depth analysis of annual reports. The author will show you that accounting, even the advanced topics, can be informative and fun.

Learn how to build a defense program against insider threats

Insiders are not always employees and insider threats are not always intentional.

This new title from Dr Julie Mehan looks beyond perimeter protection tools and shows how a security culture based on international best practice can help mitigate the insider threat to your security.

Discover:

The common characteristics of insider threat victims.
The typical stages of a malicious attack.
The steps you can take to implement a successful insider threat program.
How to construct a three-tier security culture, encompassing artifacts, values and shared assumptions.
 

&#8220;The author has many, many sound things to say about security culture and practice.&#8221;

Mark Rowe

 

Use international best practice to implement a high-impact plan

Using security controls from the ISO 27001, ISO 27002, and NIST SP 800-53 standards, this title will help you address:

Risk mitigation and the eight steps of a risk assessment
Staff training and awareness, and conducting background screening
Monitoring and auditing the activities of general and privileged users, and quickly responding to suspicious behaviors
Metrics to measure insider threat behavior and mitigation
The challenge of external or temporary insiders (such as consultants, support contractors, partners, service providers, temporary employees)
Layering physical and digital defenses to provide defense in depth
The importance of conducting regular penetration testing to evaluate security controls
Limiting, monitoring and controlling remote access and mobile device use
Ensuring supply-chain security
Maintaining an incident management capability
 

The insider threat

Every type of organization is vulnerable to insider abuse, errors or malicious attacks. These can impact reputation, operations and profitability, and expose data, harm the organization, or deliver valuable intellectual property into competitors&#8217; hands.

Insiders can be current or former employees, contractors, or other business partners who have been granted authorized access to networks, systems or data, and all of them can bypass security measures through legitimate means.

Prepare for insider threats with the most in-depth guide on the market and build a defense program using international best practice.

A handy pocket guide to service integration and management (SIAM)

IT outsourcing is the use of third-party resources to provide facilities and perform functions/services historically performed by internal IT personnel.

Historically, IT organizations have outsourced their service provision to a single managed service provider.

In today&#8217;s competitive marketplace, however, many are focusing on their core activities and relying on the support of a multi-sourcing model.

SIAM/MSI &#8211; An Introduction to Service Integration and Management/Multi-Sourcing Integration for IT Service Management explores the various characteristics of this IT operating model.

 "Very good reading material! So good, that I am considering creating this role within my org."

Silvia Prickel, United Airlines

 

Product overview

In order for multi-sourcing to be successful, organizations must be capable of integrating their service providers into a single, cohesive unit.

An in-depth guide to the changes your organization needs to make to comply with the EU GDPR.

The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will supersede the 1995 EU Data Protection Directive (DPD) and all EU member states&#8217; national laws based on it &#8211; including the UK Data Protection Act 1998 &#8211; in May 2018.

All organizations &#8211; wherever they are in the world &#8211; that process the personally identifiable information (PII) of EU residents must comply with the Regulation. Failure to do so could result in fines of up to &#8364;20 million or 4% of annual global turnover.

US organizations that process EU residents&#8217; personal data can comply with the GDPR via the EU-US Privacy Shield, which replaced the EU-US Safe Harbor framework in 2016. The Privacy Shield is based on the DPD, and will likely be updated once the GDPR is applied in May 2018.

This book provides a detailed commentary on the GDPR, explains the changes you need to make to your data protection and information security regimes, and tells you exactly what you need to do to avoid severe financial penalties.

 

Product overview

EU GDPR &#8211; An Implementation and Compliance Guide is a clear and comprehensive guide to this new data protection law, explaining the Regulation, and setting out the obligations of data processors and controllers in terms you can understand.

THE JOURNEY MATTERS AS MUCH AS THE DESTINATION.
Scrap the map and go full throttle.Most leadership books tell you how to set and achieve goals. This one is different. This one is written by a communications leader who’s as passionate about riding motorcycles as she is about running her business. Her name is Elise Mitchell, and she wants to tell you about her journey—from starting her own agency to building a world-class brand to enjoying the ride along the way. But mostly, she wants to talk to you about your journey…Ask yourself:WHERE DO YOU WANT TO GO?
Pick a destination. Not just for your career, but for your life.Answer this:HOW DO YOU PLAN TO GET THERE?
Look at the road ahead. Then plot your course.
But be prepared for some major twists, turns, and detours.Most importantly:ARE YOU ENJOYING THE JOURNEY?
If not, maybe you need to throw away the map. Restart your engine.
And get ready for the ride of your life.Whether you’re just stepping into leadership an accomplished leader seeking something more, or simply stalled along the way, Mitchell’s refreshing approach to modern leadership will help you navigate the curves and pit stops on your own path to fulfillment. You don’t need a motorcycle. You just need to get revved up for the road ahead.

ReactJS Fundamentals provides a conceptual understanding of React, an open-source JavaScript framework from Facebook, and gets you started with writing React code while utilizing advanced JavaScript and modern es6 features.DescriptionThis video training covers vanilla React, as well as a refresher on some advanced JavaScript topics, and essential es6 features. You'll first learn how to create a modern React toolchain. Next, the training covers the advanced JavaScript concepts that regularly pop up in React and the modern es6 features you'll need to write more idiomatic React code. Next the training covers a conceptual understanding of React and will take an in depth look at how React's virtual dom works.Starting in Lesson 6, you'll dive into writing React code using the original create class syntax and will begin to look at the JSX. Next, you'll see how to rewrite your earlier code using modern es6 features. From there, you'll learn the remaining vanilla React topics such as component life cycle and state management. The training wraps up with a discussion on how you can tweak performance in React apps.About the InstructorCharles Crawford IIIhas more than ten years of software experience and five years of experience in software education.

Following up on the success of his first book, Photographing Men, photographer and author Jeff Rojas has created a companion book that covers everything you need to know about photographing women. Unlike so many other books on the market that focus on photographing women—which are often just a collection of images that show different posing and lighting setups—in Photographing Women: Posing, Lighting, and Shooting Techniques for Portrait and Fashion, Jeff actually teaches you what you need to know in order to create great images.  In the book, Jeff first discusses the variety of face shapes and body types you’ll work with when photographing women. He then dives deeply into teaching you the posing, styling, and lighting techniques that will flatter your subjects and convey your intended message. In Photographing Women, you’ll learn:  •  How to identify different face shapes, and how to decide on makeup and lighting choices based on those shapes  •    The different body types that most women have—diamond, hourglass, rectangle, apple, etc.—and how best to flatter them  •    All about “perceived flaws”—such as love handles and double chins—and what to do about them  •  The difference between posing and directing your subjects  •    How to style your subject appropriately, depending on the type of shoot (portrait, boudoir, commercial, etc.)  •    How to pose your subject for standing, sitting, and lying poses  •  The lighting techniques you need to know in order to create beautiful, flattering light in your photos  •   And much more! In the final section of the book, covering lighting, Jeff brings it all together and provides 21 unique lighting setups, working through a series of shoots that cover portrait, commercial, and fashion photography.

Global market sizes for nanocoatings and coatings are expected to be $14.3 billion and $123 billion, respectively, by the year 2019. Coatings can be classified according to their applications or method of preparation or type of property imparted to the product. They can be either solvent based or water based and may be comprised of polymers or inorganic materials. Nanocoatings with thicknesses less than 100 nm can offer superior performance properties compared with conventional coatings. Nanotuff was one of the first commercial nanocoatings, it contained nanosized particles suspended in an epoxy matrix. Coatings can have specific purposes such as corrosion resistance, antiabrasive resistance, scratch resistance, chemical resistance, and stain resistance to the objects they are applied on. This book contains some new theory in the areas of solubility parameter estimates using isentropic volume expansivity, compressibility, and surface tension effects during coating flows. This volume contains chapters on methods, solvents, drying and inks, and properties.

Daniel D. Gutierrez gave this presentation on Machine Learning at Data Modeling Zone 2016 (www.DataModelingZone.com).
Machine learning can be thought of as a set of tools and methods that attempt to infer patterns and extract insight from enterprise data assets. The subject of machine learning is one that has matured considerably over the past several years. Machine learning has grown to be the facilitator of the field of data science, which is, in turn, the facilitator of big data. In this session, I will provide a high-level overview of the field by examining the two primary types of statistical learning: supervised learning and unsupervised learning. Supervised learning is the most common type, often associated with predictive analytics. We’ll discuss two classes of supervised algorithms to make predictions: regression and classification. Next, we’ll discuss the most common type of unsupervised algorithm: clustering to discover previously unknown patterns within the data.

All marketing actions, whether preceded by formal or informal decision-making processes, are based on what philosophers call &#8220;arguments.&#8221; An argument is a set of related statements comprising premises and a conclusion. Ideally, premises give an audience good reasons for accepting your argument&#8217;s conclusion. In marketing, these &#8220;conclusions&#8221; are normative decisions about what an organization should do, for example, raise prices by five percent, add a new sales territory or, perhaps, change the marketing communications mix to invest more in digital and less in print. The premises are the rationale behind why the organization should take such actions. Critical Thinking for Marketers: Learn How to Think, Not What to Think provides information and guidelines on not only how to develop good arguments, but also what it means to develop a good argument. For example, the book describes two basic kinds of arguments&#8212;deductive and inductive&#8212;and how to examine whether such arguments are &#8220;good&#8221; or not. To do this, the book explains 60 logical fallacies&#8212;or errors in reasoning&#8212;that marketers should avoid. Additionally, the authors&#8217; several &#8220;Think Better&#8221; discussions examine how fields such as philosophy, behavioral economics, and marketing theory have informed the principles of critical thinking in marketing.

The book starts with a clear and rigorous overview of role of cross-sections and their behavior in overall structural design process. Basic aspects of structural mechanics are reviewed and procedures to determine basic cross-sectional properties, stress and strain distributions, stress resultants and other response parameters, are provided. A brief discussion about the role of material behavior in cross-sectional response is also included. The unified and integrated approach to determine axial-flexural capacity of cross-sections is utilized in development of P-M and M-M interaction diagrams of cross-sections of various shapes. The behavior and design of cross-sections subjected to shear and torsion is also included with emphasis on reinforced concrete sections. Several detailed flow charts are included to demonstrate the procedures used in ACI, BS and Euro codes for design of cross-section subjected to shear and torsion, followed by solved examples. The book also presents the discussion about various factors that can lead to ductile response of cross-sections, especially those made of reinforced concrete. The definition and development of action-deformation curves especially moment-curvature (-) curve is discussed extensively. Various factors such as confinement, rebar distribution and axial load effect on the ductility are shown through examples. The use of moment-curvature curve to compute various section response parameters is also explained though equations and examples. Several typical techniques and materials for retrofitting of cross-sections of reinforced concrete beams, columns and slabs etc. are reviewed. A brief discussion of various informative references related to the evaluation and retrofitting of structures is included for practical applications. Towards the end, the book provides an overview of various software applications available for cross-section design and analysis. A framework for the development of a general-purpose cross-section analysis software, is presented and various features of few commercially available software packages are compared using some example cross-sections.Presents a generalized procedure to compute axial-flexural capacity of cross-sections of any number and configuration of materialsHeavily illustrated with schematics, diagrams, and line drawingsIncludes the convenient approach to develop P-M interaction, M-M Interaction and Moment-Curvature relationships for reinforced concrete cross-sectionsProvides detailed flowcharts for code-based (ACI, BS and Eurocode) design of reinforced concrete cross-sections subjected to axial-flexural actions as well as shear-torsion.Presents formulae and expressions to compute various commonly used cross-sectional properties of common section shapesDiscusses various parameters affecting the ductility of cross-sections and the role of confinement in the behavior reinforced concrete cross-sectionsReviews various practical retrofitting techniques to rehabilitate the damaged cross-sectionsCovers the concepts discussed in main text using various solved and unsolved numerical examplesPresents an overview of various computer applications and packages available for analysis of cross-sectionsSupported by author-developed computer-based apps to be used in conjunction with the practical applications presented in the book

The purpose of this book is to introduce the reader to mechanisms useful for detection and avoidance of money-laundering activities (MLAs) and terrorist financing as well as suggest improvements to existing anti-MLA methods and procedures where appropriate. Money laundering occurs in every country. The significant factor is to diagnose illegal MLAs and apply regulations to mitigate them. To meet this objective, managers of financial institu&#194;tions need to train their employees about anti-money-laundering pro&#194;cesses and how to diagnose and prevent them. Anti-money-laundering activities can also affect financial systems of a country. MLAs can create a big gap between income classes. Money laundering can also decrease bank's and financial institu&#194;tion's credibility. This book will be of special interest to financial managers in the pri&#194;vate and public sector and will also be a useful guide for those involved in international financial transactions.

As managers expand their international business operations, they are confronted by the puzzling and vexing world of foreign exchange (FX) rates. This book is designed as a resource that can help managers quickly understand and navigate the FX market. The text may be used as an introductory module in a course in international finance, whether the course is oriented to international markets, international investments, or international corporate finance. The primary intended audience is an applied MBA course aimed at executives, managers, and would-be managers. After an introduction to FX rates, the author covers the important topic FX rate valuation. It is important for managers to understand when an FX rate may be incorrectly valued, as this situation may have a bearing on corporate decisions on strategy, risk management, capital structure, and overseas investments and operations. He also discusses the mechanics of forward FX contracts and their use in managing the risk of future foreign currency cash flow and includes a case that unifies the ideas. The case company is faced with FX exposure in the revenues from a proposed new foreign customer. The decision maker applies the text material to estimate whether the FX rate is over-, under-, or correctly valued. The final decisions are whether to expand sales to the foreign market and whether to hedge the FX risk.
