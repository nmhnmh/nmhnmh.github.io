In football or soccer, if a player has committed some fouls or misconduct, a yellow or red card is shown by the referee to the player, and the details of the player are recorded by the referee on a small notebook, hence it's also called a 'booking'. See more on [Fouls and Miscouduct on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fouls_and_misconduct_(association_football)). Here in this twitter, booking has its own special meaning here, which is strongly related to its football context, it's kind of a football jargon.
